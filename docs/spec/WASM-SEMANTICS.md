# WasmGC Backend Semantics: the physical-encoding + host-boundary supplement

**Status:** specification (supplement). **Scope:** the two things
`docs/spec/EMITTER-SEMANTICS.md` deliberately left out of the shared refinement
contract: (1) the **WasmGC physical encoding** of the abstract value contract
(`compiler/RUNTIME-DESIGN.md` §8.6, ratified 2026-06-07), stated as laws; and
(2) the **host-boundary contract** — the part of wasm's semantics that lives in
JS host imports (`test/wasm/run.js`, `playground/worker.js`, `playground/compile.mjs`),
which is wasm's
biggest specification hole. §4 is the wasm arm of EMITTER-SEMANTICS §9: every
shared law → wasm status → issue.

## 0. What this document is NOT

It is **not a second refinement contract.** `docs/spec/EMITTER-SEMANTICS.md`
already binds the wasm refinement `W(P)` (its §0/§1: R2 quantifies over all
four engines, and every V/N/T/S/M/D law binds "all engines and every reflective
helper"). A wasm defect against those laws cites the *shared* law; this
document only adds the wasm-specific representation and boundary laws the
shared contract could not state without naming a backend. Where this spec and
`compiler/backend/wasm_emit.mdk` disagree, the disagreement is a finding to
triage, not a description error — same discipline as the parent document.

Audit provenance: founding audit 2026-07-16 at `be6159f3` (three parallel
static passes + binary probes; probe method: `medaka build` native vs
`medaka build --target wasm` + `node test/wasm/run.js`, eval arm via
`medaka run`). Verification legend follows `compiler/TYPECHECK-AUDIT.md`:
**CONFIRMED** / **LATENT** / **STATIC**.

## 1. The physical encoding contract (WP-laws)

WasmGC implements the §8.6 abstract value contract with **`(ref eq)` + i31 +
typed structs** in place of native's tagged word. The encoding never leaks
above Core IR; these laws are the wasm peers of EMITTER-SEMANTICS §2 (V1–V6).

- **WP1 — Uniform slot.** Every abstract value position (params, returns,
  fields, array elements, dict slots) is `(ref eq)`. Generics erase to
  `(ref eq)` + downcast — the same erasure dict-passing assumes. (Peer of V1.)
- **WP2 — Two-tier Int, one semantics.** `Int` in `[−2³⁰, 2³⁰)` is an
  `i31ref` immediate; outside that range it boxes as `$boxint`
  `(struct (field i64))`. The split is the ratified "one honest asymmetry":
  a **performance** fact, never a semantic one. The binding obligation:
  **the i64 field is a container for a 63-bit value, not a license for 64-bit
  arithmetic** — every producer of an `Int` (arithmetic result, extern return,
  literal) must land in the 63-bit domain of N1, wrapping modulo 2⁶³ exactly
  as native's tag-shift does. An unnormalized `$boxint` holding a value
  outside `[intMinBound, intMaxBound]` is a V2-class corruption: it prints,
  compares, and hashes as a number no other engine can produce. (Status: ✗
  CONFIRMED — see §4 N1 row.)
- **WP3 — Boxed cells are nominal-by-discriminant.** Heap aggregates are
  typed structs/arrays (`$float` `(struct f64)`, `$str`, `$arr`, `$tupN`,
  `$ref`, `$cons`, per-ctor structs). Because WasmGC subtyping is structural,
  two same-shape constructors are **not** distinguishable by `ref.test` —
  the explicit `i32` discriminant at field 0 of every ADT struct is therefore
  **mandatory, not an optimization** (peer of V4). Field-less constructors are
  i31 immediates carrying their ordinal.
- **WP4 — Tag spaces.** Match discrimination uses the ratified dense per-type
  ctor ordinal (`br_table`-ready — the native backend's target design, which
  wasm already implements). Dict-witness tags are name-hash-derived i32s
  (`dictTag`); the V4/M2 injectivity burden applies **with less headroom than
  native** (i32-truncated hash space, and the known layer-17 residual: wasm's
  dispatch-hash constants differ from native's i64 ones by 2³⁰-scale deltas —
  self-consistent, but a per-backend tag space that must independently satisfy
  M2). Like native (#348), wasm has **no emit-time collision check** on the
  hashed spaces.
- **WP5 — Strings.** `(array i8)` UTF-8 bytes + cached codepoint count —
  the same locked rep as native (RUNTIME-DESIGN §7 decision 2), so
  `stringLength` is a field read and string equality is byte equality.
- **WP6 — Closures.** Uniform code type + **arity carried in the closure
  struct** + universal `$mdk_apply` doing exact/under (PAP)/over (saturate +
  re-apply) dispatch. This is the design that kills the native table-miss
  class by construction; it is also the reference design EMITTER-SEMANTICS
  cites for node-carried decisions (the fallthrough label is threaded as an
  argument here, not stashed in a mutable Ref — why wasm never had the
  refutable-guard miscompile).
- **WP7 — Tail calls.** `return_call` / `return_call_ref` at every syntactic
  tail position (S1/S2's engine mechanism, guaranteed by Wasm 3.0). Exception:
  a tail call into a **host import** cannot be guaranteed-tail; a plain `call`
  there is conformant (host imports are leaf effect calls).
- **WP8 — Coded traps precede engine traps.** Wasm has no stderr; a Medaka
  trap is realized as: stream the coded `runtime error [E-*]: …` line through
  `mdk_write_err_byte`, then execute `unreachable`. The T1 obligation on this
  encoding: **every reachable trap fires the coded line first.** A path that
  reaches a raw engine trap (`ref.cast` failure, `i64.trunc_f64_s` range
  trap, `i64.div_s` edge) with no preceding coded line violates T1 — the
  user sees the engine's message ("illegal cast", "float unrepresentable in
  integer range"), which is an observation no other engine produces.
  (Status: ✅ the `floatToInt` violation is FIXED — #346/#372; `$mdk_float_to_int`
  now saturates via `i64.trunc_sat_f64_s` and never reaches the range trap, so
  there is no uncoded engine trap left on that path. See §4 N7 row.)
- **WP9 — The wasm reflective surface.** The `$mdk_value_*` WAT helpers
  (`$mdk_value_add/sub/mul/div/mod`, `$mdk_value_cmp`, `$mdk_value_eq`,
  `$mdk_value_cmp_num`/`$mdk_value_eq_num`, hash helpers, `$mdk_append`) are
  wasm's V6 reflective surface: each branches on a value's runtime shape
  (`ref.test`), each independently owes the §4 numeric laws, and adding one
  is a spec change. They are enumerated in the §4 V6 row.

- **WP10 — Eager value-global init is ordered by DEPENDENCY, not source.**
  (Status: ✗ **CONFIRMED BROKEN — #553**; the law is stated here because it was
  UNWRITTEN until #543 exploited its absence.) A nullary top-level binding is a
  wasm value **global**, initialized eagerly in `$__init` under `(start $__init)`.
  A global whose initializer reads another value global must be emitted **after**
  it, or it reads `ref.null` and `ref.as_non_null` traps *"dereferencing a null
  pointer"* at instantiate — before a single line of user code runs.
  `topoSortValBinds` (`backend/wasm_emit.mdk`) exists to enforce exactly this.
  **It does not, and the gap is precise:** its edges come from `eagerVars`
  (`backend/emit_support.mdk`), a **direct** free-var scan of the binding's own
  body that does **not follow calls into a callee**. So `g = Ref (mk ())` yields
  the single edge `mk` — a *function*, not a value bind, hence **no edge at all** —
  and any global `mk`'s body reads is invisible. Source order then decides, and
  #543 is what that costs: `crossRun` read `initialEnv` through `freshCrossRun`,
  was ordered 97 lines early, and killed the entire playground.
  ⚠️ **This is NOT a wasm-only law, and NOT playground-only — BOTH BACKENDS ARE
  BROKEN ON ORDINARY USER CODE.** `llvm_emit.mdk`'s `orderedValBinds` is fed by
  `bindFreeVars` = the **same shared `eagerVars`**, with the same blind spot, and
  its own doc comment says an unordered eager forward ref *"captures the still-zero
  global cell"*. This 12-line program — the minimal shape of the law — was run
  through all three SHIPPING engines (2026-07-16):

  ```medaka
  data Env = Env (List Int)
  mkEnv : Unit -> Env
  mkEnv _ = base          -- reads the `base` global, but only INSIDE a callee
  cell : Env
  cell = mkEnv ()         -- eager global; only eager var is `mkEnv` ⇒ NO edge
  base : Env
  base = Env [1, 2, 3]    -- declared after `cell` ⇒ source order loses
  size : Env -> Int
  size e = match e
    Env xs => 7
  main = println (size cell)
  ```

  | engine | verdict |
  |---|---|
  | eval | `7` ✅ |
  | **native** | **SIGSEGV — exit 139** |
  | **wasm** | `instantiate failed: dereferencing a null pointer` |

  **Only eval is correct.** So native is not merely *exposed* — it is
  **EXPLOITABLE from user code**, and it fails as a **segfault or a silent zero**
  where wasm traps loudly with a named cause. That asymmetry is the only reason
  this was ever found: #543 surfaced solely because the playground's arm is the
  wasm one. The general fix (#553, an eager-reachability closure that follows
  calls) MUST cover **both** backends — a wasm-only fix would leave the arm that
  fails SILENTLY live, which is the worse class.
  ⚠️ An earlier draft of #543 claimed *"native is unaffected — it does not eagerly
  init these"*. That was **FALSE**, propagated into #553's body, and is corrected
  here with receipts. It was never grep-proven; the receipts above took ten minutes.
  Until #553 lands, a value global whose initializer reaches another global
  through a **call** is unsound on both backends; keep the read in the binding's
  own body (pass it as an argument) so `eagerVars` can see it.
  ⚠️ **No gate covers this, and placing one is BLOCKED — the reason is worth
  recording so it is not rediscovered.** The only artifact that compiles the whole
  compiler to wasm is the playground build: nightly-only, not required. The
  12-line reproducer above runs in ~1 s and would be ideal, but it cannot land
  green while #553 is open, and the two prescribed homes both refuse it:
  * **`test/wasm/fixtures/`** — `diff_wasm.sh` has **no per-fixture ledger** of any
    kind (`engine_divergence.txt` is consulted by `diff_compiler_engines.sh` ALONE),
    so a known-broken fixture there simply turns a gate red.
  * **`test/llvm_fixtures/`** — `diff_compiler_engines.sh` *does* have the
    self-draining ledger, and it is the right mechanism. But **every category the
    ledger offers is a false claim here**: `wasm:codegen-bug` / `wasm:emitter-gap`
    are wrong (native SIGSEGVs too), and there is **no `native:*` codegen category
    at all** — the taxonomy has no cell for "one shared emitter helper, both
    backends wrong". Writing the nearest label would reproduce precisely the
    failure `engine_divergence.txt`'s own header documents at length (*"THE CATEGORY
    IS A CLAIM. VERIFY IT — a wrong one launders a bug behind a plausible label"*;
    17+ rows have already dissolved that way) — and it would re-tell the very
    "wasm-only" story this law exists to correct.
  ⇒ **#553 needs a ledger category (e.g. `emitter:shared-eager-init`) before its
  fixture can land.** That is a taxonomy decision, not a mechanical add.

## 2. The host-boundary contract (WH-laws)

Native's TCB below the emitted IR is `runtime/medaka_rt.c`. Wasm's is **three
JS files** — `test/wasm/run.js` (Node runner: gates, CLI users),
`playground/worker.js` (runs the USER's compiled program — the 0.1.0 front door)
and `playground/compile.mjs` (runs the COMPILER itself, i.e. `playground.wasm`;
imported by `compiler-worker.js`, `language-worker.js` and the node drivers) —
plus the engine. ⚠️ This said **two** until 2026-07-16 and the omitted third is
where #543 landed: believing the TCB was two files is precisely what let #370's
fix update two copies and leave the third on raw `Number()`, LinkError-ing the
playground dead. **Derive the set, never trust the count:**
`grep -rlE '^// --- BEGIN SHARED SHIM' test/ playground/` — which is what
`test/diff_compiler_wasm_shim_parity.sh` now does, so a fourth host enrols itself. Parts of the
observable semantics (float formatting, string→float parsing, process exit,
the entire IO surface) execute **in JS, not in the module**. That makes the
import surface part of the semantics, with laws:

- **WH1 — The import surface is closed and enumerated.** Every `env.*` import
  the emitter can declare is listed in §3 with a pinned contract. A new host
  import is a spec change: it lands with (a) a §3 row, (b) implementations or
  explicit capability stubs in **every** shim — the set is the one
  `test/diff_compiler_wasm_shim_parity.sh` DERIVES, not a remembered pair; #543
  shipped because "both" was believed of a set of three — and (c) a
  `test/CAPABILITY-EXCEPTIONS.txt` disposition if any engine withholds it.
- **WH2 — The C runtime is the behavioral oracle.** Where a host import
  reimplements something `medaka_rt.c` implements natively, the JS copy must
  be **byte-identical on the observable surface**: `mdk_float_fmt` ≡
  `mdk_float_lexeme` (N9's "one formatter" law quantifies over FOUR copies:
  the C one and the THREE `fmt12g`s — it read "the two `fmt12g`s" until #543,
  and the uncounted third had silently stayed on the pre-#361 `%.12g` formatter), `mdk_str_to_float` ≡ the `strtod`
  acceptance set (spelling set for inf/nan, empty-string rejection, trailing
  garbage, C99 hex floats), `mdk_exit` ≡ flush-then-exit. "Close enough for the
  fixtures" is how the `stringToFloat` divergence shipped (#370 — `Number("")` is
  `0`, `strtod("")` is a parse failure). #370 also shows the oracle constrains the
  SEAM, not just the shim: `strtod("nan")` SUCCEEDS with a NaN value, so a seam that
  returns only an f64 and reads NaN as failure cannot express the C contract at all
  — hence the separate `mdk_str_to_float_ok` channel. A JS shim behavior with no C-oracle
  equivalent (worker sandbox stubs) must be a **loud, named** capability
  error, never a value.
- **WH3 — Shim parity, LinkError ban.** Both shims provide the **same `env`
  key set**. A capability the playground sandbox withholds must still be a
  *callable* that raises the friendly `CapabilityError` at call time —
  instantiation must never fail with a raw `LinkError` on a module the
  compiler legally emitted. (Status: ✗ CONFIRMED — `worker.js` is missing the
  `mdk_write_file_reset/push/commit` trio; §4 R3 row.)
- **WH4 — Flush discipline.** On normal completion, `exit`, and trap alike:
  buffered stdout bytes, then buffered stderr bytes, are delivered before the
  process/worker stops (R1's observation triple includes stderr-on-trap).
  (Status: ✗ CONFIRMED — `run.js` `mdk_exit` drops accumulated stderr; §4 T1
  row.)
- **WH5 — GC refs never cross the boundary.** Strings and buffers marshal
  through the byte-channel protocol only: guest pushes path/name bytes
  (`mdk_path_reset`/`mdk_path_push`), host caches result bytes exposed as
  `(mdk_result_len, mdk_result_byte)`; args as `(count, len(i), byte(i,j))`;
  file writes stream through `mdk_write_file_push` and commit atomically.
  The protocol is stateful per module instance; imports that consume the path
  buffer (`takePath`) must be called in the guest's push→consume order.
- **WH6 — Engine baseline is pinned.** Node ≥ 24 (CI pins the dev box's
  major), `wasm-tools` parse+validate as the assembler gate; Wasmtime needs
  `-W gc -W tail-call`. The playground must feature-detect WasmGC (#75) —
  an unsupported browser is a *named* failure, not a hang.

## 3. Host-import inventory (the wasm TCB surface)

> One row per `env.*` import name the emitter can declare. "Emitted when":
> imports are declared per **group** when the program's extern usage pulls the
> group in, not per individual extern — a pure program declares only the core
> quartet (`mdk_write_byte`, `mdk_write_err_byte`, `mdk_float_fmt`,
> `mdk_float_fmt_byte`; probe-verified 2026-07-16).

| Law | Wasm status | Evidence / issue |
|---|---|---|
| R1/R2 refinement | ✅ sampled | `diff_wasm` (154) + `diff_wasm_typed` + `diff_wasm_modules` + `diff_sqlite` + `diff_compiler_engines`; violations pinned in `test/engine_divergence.txt`. ⚠ coverage caveat: the CI `wasm` job is **advisory, not a required check** (`ci.yml`: "a red wasm job does not BLOCK a merge yet") |
| R3 — rejection fidelity | ⚠ | emitter gaps land as loud `BuildErr` diagnostics via the subprocess seam (`build_cmd.mdk` wraps the E-PANIC — disposition conformant); quality defects: range-pattern gap prints `?`, native-only externs die as "unbound variable" — **#380** |
| R4 — totality | ✗ CONFIRMED | reachable ref-mode gaps: recursive `let..in`, refutable guard in tail arm, range patterns — **#379** (still open); the string/char-literal match-head **invalid-module** class (the forbidden third disposition; only `wasm-tools validate` makes it loud) — **#374 FIXED** by #511 (ref-mode literal switch now carries the twin's `unreachable` terminator; Int literals had the same gap and were fixed too). Row verdict stays ✗ CONFIRMED on #379 alone. Scalar-mode gaps (CRecord/W7 rows) are **unreachable from check-accepted input** — any ctor/string/closure forces ref-mode; those ledger rows are ill-typed fixtures reaching an emitter that doesn't gate on type errors |
| R5 — no UB | ⚠ | the `INT64_MIN /(−1)` div-overflow trap is **GONE** — #368's renormalization makes i64 `INT64_MIN` unreachable, so the claim it invalidated holds again. Pinned by `arith_int63_div_intmin`, whose dividend is `intMinBound + intMinBound` — an ADD that overflows to exactly **−2^63**, since `i64.div_s` traps only on `INT64_MIN` and `intMinBound` is −2^62, **not** INT64_MIN (a `intMinBound / −1` fixture yields a wrong value, not a trap, and pins nothing here — that case is `arith_int63_div_wrap`, which covers the scalar `/` renormalization instead). Verified against the pre-fix emitter: trap → `0`. Residual: dispatch-chain `unreachable`s cite coherence but are invalidated under #377 collision / #324 key-space mismatch. **#372 FIXED** (`i64.trunc_f64_s` is now `i64.trunc_sat_f64_s` + a 63-bit clamp before the box seam, `wasm_preamble.mdk:1146` — see the N7 row) — no longer a residual here |

| N1 — 63-bit wrap | ✅ | **#368 FIXED** — sign-extend from bit 62 (`(x << 1) >> 1`, mirroring native's tag/untag) at BOTH Int seams: `$mdk_box_int` (ref mode re-boxes after every op, and it is the sole `$boxint` producer ⇒ "a `(ref eq)` Int holds a 63-bit value" is a representation invariant) and, separately, at each scalar-mode `+ - * /` — scalar mode (`useRef == False`) never boxes, so the box seam alone would have left 64-bit intermediates. Pinned by `arith_int63_wrap_scalar` / `arith_int63_wrap_boxed` |
| N2 — div/mod | ⚠ | inline paths guarded with coded traps, codes match (probe); poly helper arms unguarded (**#371**); `INT_MIN/−1` is structurally unreachable again now that #368 renormalizes (`arith_int63_div_intmin`) |
| N3 — Int literals | ✅ | i31 / `i64.const`+box split exact over the legal range; out-of-range is a frontend reject |
| N4 — IEEE ops | ⚠ | inline `f64.add/sub/mul/div` ✅ no fast-math; `%` ✅ **exact fmod on BOTH the inline and poly paths** — **#369 FIXED** by #388 (`53f63fbd`), which landed N4 as ONE cross-engine semantics with native #345: `$mdk_float_rem` is the libm power-of-two reduction (`wasm_preamble.mdk:1024-1046`) and `$mdk_value_mod`'s Float arm routes to it (`:730-734`); re-verified 2026-07-16 with 36 probes (inline+poly × 6 cases × 3 engines, incl. `1.0e17 % 3.0` → `1.0` and `1.0e300 % 1.0e-300`), pinned by `test/wasm/fixtures/polynum_mod_float{,_large,_neg}.mdk`. **Residual ⚠ (NOT the old S0):** transcendentals are JS `Math.*` host imports (sub-ULP vs C libm, ledgered class — §3 row 14) |
| N5 — IEEE compare, uniformly | ✅ | inline predicates ✅ (probe: `nan==nan` False, `!=` True, `<`/`<=` False; `-0.0` prints/compares right); `$mdk_value_eq` ✅; the type-lost relational path **#305 FIXED** — `$mdk_value_lt/le/gt/ge`(`_num`) answer a `$float` operand with a direct `f64` predicate (IEEE, False at NaN) and use the 3-way only for `$str`/int, **in lockstep with native** |
| N6 — total-order story | ✅ | **DECIDED + IMPLEMENTED 2026-07-16 (#360)**: `compare`/`min`/`max`/`sort` at Float = IEEE-754 totalOrder (−NaN < −inf … +inf < +NaN). Implemented ONCE, in `impl Ord Float` (`stdlib/core.mdk`) — it is prelude Medaka, not backend code, so wasm inherits it with no `wasm_emit.mdk` change and no divergence surface. Derived `<`/`<=`/`>`/`>=` stay primitive IEEE on every path (all four False at NaN): the impl explicitly overrides them, since Ord's DEFAULTS would derive them from `compare` and re-open **#305**. `min`/`max` keep the compare-derived defaults on purpose. **VERIFIED on wasm** 2026-07-16: `medaka build --target wasm` of `test/build_diff_fixtures/float_totalorder_nan.mdk` under `node test/wasm/run.js` is **byte-identical to eval, the Core IR interpreter and native** across all 38 cells (26 totalOrder laws + the 12 N5 cells, all False). ⚠ But **not GATE-pinned on the wasm arm**: the fixture is prelude-bearing, and every corpus in `diff_compiler_engines.sh`'s union is ALSO consumed by a prelude-FREE probe gate (`diff_compiler_llvm_typed.sh`, `diff_wasm.sh`/`diff_wasm_typed.sh` run bare probes over `runtime.mdk` only, and a real prelude emit hits the W6/W7 gaps — see those gates' headers), so adding a prelude-bearing fixture to any of them would break the probe gate. eval/Core IR/native ARE gate-pinned. ⚠️ This row used to cite closing this hole (a prelude-bearing 3-engine corpus) as "the wasm-arm half of #102" — verified WRONG (#438 sweep): #102 is CLOSED and is entirely about the wasm CI job ("T25") having no tracking issue, unrelated to this gate-coverage gap. Removed the citation rather than guess a replacement; this specific gap currently has no tracking issue — file one before citing a number here again |
| N7 — conversions total | ✅ **FIXED (#346/#372)** | `$mdk_float_to_int` = `i64.trunc_sat_f64_s` **then clamped** to the 63-bit `intMinBound`/`intMaxBound` before the `$mdk_box_int` seam — `trunc_sat` alone saturates to i64 bounds, which the box seam would renormalize to `−1` rather than the bound (the clamp is pinned by `float_to_int_clamp_i64`). NaN→0, ±inf/out-of-range→`intMaxBound`/`intMinBound`, no trap; eval==native==wasm. `intToFloat` ✅ (`f64.convert_i64_s`) |
| N8 — know, don't guess | ✗ STATIC (architectural) | the wasm recovery stack: `cexprIsFloat` structural arms, `refMainKind` defaults-to-Int, `numPolyLocalsRef` lexical seeding — wasm arm of umbrella **#353**; mitigations: the typecheck `RScalar` stamp is read first, and most wrong guesses die as loud `ref.cast` traps, not garbage |
| N9 — one formatter, round-trip | ✅ **verified** | the three copies (`mdk_float_lexeme`, two `fmt12g`s) reviewed element-by-element + 22-case probe battery byte-identical (incl. −0.0, denormals, 3-digit exponents, 17-digit shortest) — the #361 wasm verification; WAT `f64.const` literal serialization bit-exact via the same formatter; residual: stale `%.12g` comments — **#383** |
| T1 — closed coded taxonomy | ⚠ | `E-DIV-ZERO`/`E-MOD-ZERO`/`E-INDEX-OOB`/`E-NONEXHAUSTIVE-MATCH`/`E-PANIC` coded, stdout-flushed, exit-1 parity (probes); **uncoded engine traps reachable** via #371/#372 (WP8 violations; the #368 div-overflow corollary is FIXED — that trap is now unreachable); `CTFail` is a coded trap, better than a bare `unreachable` |
| T2 — traps ≠ values | ✅ | no catch mechanism; codes agree where coded |
| T3 — stack overflow | ⚠ unaudited | engine-reported exhaustion; not probed this audit |
| S1/S2 — tail calls / TRMC | ✅ gated | `return_call`/`return_call_ref` (fixture-asserted IR shape); TMC parity + EXPECT-TMC coverage pins (`tmc_parity`; residual #224 is the check_main leg) |
| M1 — mangling injective | ✗ STATIC | `gname` near-identity punctures + separator-ambiguous `implFnSym`, no post-mangle check — **#378** (order constraint with #324's sanitizer); #324 canonical-key symbols |
| M3 — private invisible | ✅ inherited | universal mangling shared with native (upstream of both emitters) |
| D1 — deterministic emission | ✅ | probe: byte-identical `.wasm` across rebuilds; static pass: all Refs reset per program, no env/clock reads, sequential counters |
| D2/D3 — fixpoint + seed | n/a / ⚠ | wasm has no seed and no self-compile fixpoint; the wasm **self-host** (playground.wasm = the compiler on WasmGC) is linkage-gated (`assemble_check_main.sh`: parse+validate+zero undefined wrappers) but has **no fixpoint-analog behavior gate** — open D2-style assurance gap, noted in #384 |
| D4 — own-source competence | ⚠ | the D4-analog closure is "what the playground compiler emits for itself"; unaudited beyond the linkage gate |
| Perf posture | ⚠ | **#381 FIXED** by #401 (`5d82fa48`): `ctorOrdinal`'s per-(slot,branch) whole-table rescan was **CUBIC** — O(N ctors × B branches × C table), measured 7.91×/8.35× per doubling at N=400/800 on the DCE-running probe — now memoized to **1.90× (linear)**, a 53× win at N=400, proven by byte-identical WAT across 200 fixtures. ⚠ It was **never "wasm-specific"**: `llvm_emit`'s `ctorOrdinal` has the **same** scan and a **quadratic** twin (3.71/3.73 at N=1000→4000, **#408**); only the slot×branch nesting was wasm's. `indent` (**#381**'s own second finding — NOT #382) is fixed for the re-copying (8.1×) but **cannot reach linear** — the if/else chain nests arm *k* at depth *k*, so the output is inherently O(arms²) **bytes**. Residual: the #349–#352 sibling census (**#382**); enforcement — the **native** emit stage shipped (#396), and **the wasm arm is now shipped too — #359 FIXED** (2026-07-16: `diff_compiler_perf_scaling` grades the wasm emit stage, closing the O(n²) detector's own wasm gap), grading **TIME** (pure scans allocate nothing) |
| WH1 — enumerated imports | ✅ | §3 inventory (grep-complete; dead W2 scaffold imports verified never-emitted) |
| WH2 — C-runtime oracle | ✅ **HELD** | `mdk_str_to_float` was JS `Number()`, not strtod (`""`→`Some 0.0`, `"1.5 "`→`Some 1.5`, `"nan"`/`"inf"`→`None`, `"0x1p4"`→`None`) — **#370 FIXED**: every shim now implements the strtod acceptance set (⚠️ as
landed, #370 reached only TWO of the three — `playground/compile.mjs` was left on raw
`Number()` AND missing the new `mdk_str_to_float_ok` import, LinkError-ing the playground
dead until #543 completed it and made the gate derive its host set) (leading-ws-only, full consumption, inf/nan spellings, C99 hex floats), derived from the C oracle over a 621-case battery and pinned on all three engines by `test/llvm_fixtures/str_to_float_frontier.mdk`; `mdk_float_fmt` ✅ verified (N9 row) |
| WH3 — shim parity, LinkError ban | ✗ CONFIRMED (env-key half) | `worker.js` missing `mdk_write_file_reset/push/commit` → raw LinkError on `writeFileBytes` programs (node simulation with worker's exact env set) — **#375**, still open. The SHARED-BLOCK half is now mechanised: `test/diff_compiler_wasm_shim_parity.sh` (a required `gates (frontend)` shard) byte-diffs every `--- SHARED SHIM ---` region across all **three** hosts (`run.js`, `worker.js`, `compile.mjs`). ⚠️ It covered only the first TWO until 2026-07-16: `compile.mjs` (the seam that runs the COMPILER) holds its own copy of both blocks, and the gate's blindness to it is precisely how #543 shipped — #370's fix updated the two gated copies, leaving `compile.mjs` on raw `Number()` and missing the new `mdk_str_to_float_ok` import (LinkError → playground dead), while its `fmt12g` sat on the pre-#361 `%.12g` formatter. Fixed in #543. It found `fmt12g` had ALREADY drifted (comments/whitespace only — behaviour unaffected) under the "copied verbatim" comment that was the only prior enforcement. The env-KEY-SET half (#375) is still unchecked by any gate |
| WH4 — flush discipline | ✗ CONFIRMED | `run.js` `mdk_exit` writes stdout, **drops buffered stderr** — **#376**; trap path flushes both ✅ (probe: pre-trap stdout delivered) |
| WP10 — eager value-global init ordered by dependency | ✗ **CONFIRMED — #553** | `topoSortValBinds`'s edges come from `eagerVars`, a DIRECT free-var scan that does not follow calls, so a global read reached through a call yields NO edge and source order decides → `ref.null` + *"dereferencing a null pointer"* at instantiate. Exploited by **#543** (`crossRun` → `freshCrossRun` → `initialEnv`, ordered 97 lines early, playground dead). ⚠️ **NOT wasm-only and NOT playground-only**: `llvm_emit`'s `orderedValBinds` uses the SAME shared `eagerVars`. A **12-line user program** (§1 WP10) measured across the three SHIPPING engines gives **eval `7` / native SIGSEGV (exit 139) / wasm `dereferencing a null pointer`** — only eval is right, so native is **EXPLOITABLE from user code**, not merely exposed. In the COMPILER's own graph native escapes only by luck: `resetCrossModuleState ()` overwrites the poisoned bundle before any reader dereferences it (pre-fix IR receipt: `crossRun` stored at prologue line 1693 vs `initialEnv` at 1768; `global i64 0` loaded inside `freshCrossRun`). **Native fails as a segfault/silent zero, wasm as a named trap** — the asymmetry is why only the playground surfaced it — so #553 must fix BOTH arms; a wasm-only fix leaves the silent one live. #543 restored the edge at the one known site (`freshCrossRun` takes the env as an arg) — a point fix, not the law. **Ungated**: only the playground build compiles the whole compiler to wasm, and it is nightly + non-required |
| WH5 — byte-channel only | ✅ | no GC ref crosses an import signature (inventory) |
| WH6 — engine baseline | ⚠ | node 24 + wasm-tools pinned in CI; playground WasmGC feature-detect still open (**#75**); the CI wasm job is not a required check (R1 row) |

## 5. Reading recurring wasm defects against this spec

- **"illegal cast" at instantiate** → N8/WP2: a static scalar-type guess
  committed to the Int path over a `$float` (or vice versa); find which
  registry (`cexprIsFloat` arm, float-param/ret table) missed the fact the
  typechecker knew.
- **"func N failed to validate"** → an R3 violation *class of its own*: the
  emitter produced an invalid module instead of a named `gapL` rejection.
  The `wasm-tools validate` step is the backstop that makes it loud, but the
  diagnostic names no construct — triage by minimizing the fixture.
- **"instantiate failed: <engine text>"** with no `runtime error [E-*]` line
  → WP8/T1: a raw engine trap on a path that never streamed its coded line —
  or WH3: a LinkError from a shim missing an import.
- **A large wrong number, no error** → WP2/N1 (an unnormalized `$boxint` —
  wasm-only value), or a tag leak (odd `2n+1` reading of an i31 — the
  `charCode charMaxBound` shape).
- **Wrong answer only via a HOF / only when type-lost** → the `$mdk_value_*`
  runtime helpers (WP9): the reflective surface re-implements the operation;
  check its shape arms against N4/N5/N6.
- **Works in run.js, breaks in the playground** → WH3 shim-parity; diff the
  two `env` objects before diffing the module.
