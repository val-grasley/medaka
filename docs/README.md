# Docs index

<!-- GENERATED — do not edit by hand; run `make docs-index`
     (test/gen_docs_index.sh). Regenerating after a doc move/add/rename is a
     no-op if nothing changed: same input -> byte-identical output. -->

Fast lookup for an agent (or human) trying to find the right doc. Each row
leads with the doc, then a one-line summary and its current status (pulled
straight from the doc's own `**Status:**` banner — this table cannot drift
from what the doc says about itself). **PARTIAL/OPEN work is live; a doc
under `archive/` is IMPLEMENTED/SUPERSEDED and kept for provenance, not
current guidance.**

Root entry points (not indexed below — always here): [`README.md`](../README.md)
(build/test/CLI), [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) (agent orientation, router),
[`PLAN.md`](../PLAN.md) (open roadmap), [`HANDOFF.md`](../HANDOFF.md)
(start-here snapshot — its own banner flags it partly stale; treat as a
pointer to `docs/ops/DISTRIBUTION-DESIGN.md` / `docs/ops/RELEASE-0.1.0-PLAN.md`
for current status, not as live guidance itself).

### spec — language ground truth

What parses, what it means, formal semantics. Read here first for "does X exist / what does X mean".

| Doc | What it is | Status |
|-----|------------|--------|
| [`DICT-SEMANTICS.md`](spec/DICT-SEMANTICS.md) | Dictionary-Passing Semantics for Medaka Interfaces | specification |

### guide — learning path

Tutorial-style onboarding, not a spec. Not yet cross-linked into this index's status convention (no banners) — this is prose-in-progress, read for teaching order, not ground truth.

| Doc | What it is | Status |

| [`OUTLINE.md`](guide/OUTLINE.md) | Medaka Guide — Outline | — |

### design — open/partial work

Live design docs: **OPEN** = not started, **PARTIAL** = in progress. Read before touching the area; update the doc when you close it (then it moves to `archive/design/`).

### ops — release, testing, distribution

Cross-cutting process docs: how the test suite is organized, how a build ships, what's left before 0.1.0.

### compiler internals — stay in compiler/, indexed here for findability

### archive — closed / historical

IMPLEMENTED or SUPERSEDED work, kept for provenance. Links inside these docs are NOT rewritten when they narrate a past tree (flat files below + `PLAN-ARCHIVE.md`); `design/` and `findings/` are current archived docs whose links ARE kept live. See [`archive/README.md`](../archive/README.md) for the layout explanation.
