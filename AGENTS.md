# AGENTS.md

Orientation for AI agents working on **Medaka**, a pragmatic functional language that
**self-hosts to a reproducing fixpoint**: the whole pipeline is written in Medaka
(`compiler/*.mdk`) and compiles via a native LLVM backend
(`compiler/backend/llvm_emit.mdk` → text IR → `clang`; C runtime `runtime/medaka_rt.c` +
Boehm GC) to an OCaml-free `medaka` binary. Native is the **sole** compiler — the OCaml
reference compiler was removed 2026-06-26 (tag `oracle-frozen` preserves the last
`lib/`-present commit).

**This file is a *router*: maps, traps, and links.** It does not teach. For prose,
rationale, and post-mortems, follow the links — and don't assume detail that isn't here.

`compiler/` is ONE Medaka project (`compiler/medaka.toml`); each stage is one `.mdk` file
under a subfolder: `frontend/` (lex/parse/AST/desugar/resolve/marker/exhaust), `types/`
(typecheck + annotate), `ir/` (Core IR, DCE, S-expr), `backend/` (LLVM + WasmGC emit, TRMC,
mangling), `eval/` (tree-walk interpreter), `driver/` (loader, diagnostics, build, CLI),
`tools/` (fmt/printer/LSP/test/repl/doc/new/lint), `support/` (compiler-private
mini-stdlib), `entries/` (per-stage probe entry points), `seed/` (checked-in LLVM IR seed
for cold bootstrap).

## Pipeline — where each stage lives

**Execution order** (driven by `compiler/driver/medaka_cli.mdk` — *not* the order files are
listed):

```
lexer.mdk → parser.mdk → ast.mdk → desugar.mdk → resolve.mdk → marker.mdk
  → typecheck.mdk (runs exhaust.mdk internally) → eval.mdk
  [all in compiler/frontend/ except typecheck.mdk (types/) and eval.mdk (eval/)]
```

Two non-obvious facts that bite when deciding *where* a check belongs:

- **`desugar.mdk` runs FIRST**, before resolve/typecheck. Surface-sugar nodes (`EGuards`,
  `ESection`, `EStringInterp`, `EDo`) are **already lowered to core** by the time
  typecheck/exhaust/eval see the tree. A check that needs the sugar shape (e.g. guard
  *coverage* on `EGuards`) cannot live in typecheck/exhaust — it must run pre-desugar (see
  `checkGuardExhaustiveness` in `compiler/frontend/exhaust.mdk`, a standalone pass on the
  raw AST).
- **`exhaust.mdk` is not a standalone later stage** — `checkMatchExhaustive` is *called
  from inside* `compiler/types/typecheck.mdk` (once per `EMatch`, with the scrutinee type
  known). It only ever sees core patterns.

| Stage | File | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| Lex | `compiler/frontend/lexer.mdk` | Indentation-sensitive; emits INDENT/DEDENT/NEWLINE |
| Parse | `compiler/frontend/parser.mdk` | Recursive-descent grammar |
| AST | `compiler/frontend/ast.mdk` | Node types + source locations |
| Desugar | `compiler/frontend/desugar.mdk` | Runs FIRST. Lowers `deriving`, record puns, `EGuards`/`ESection`/`EStringInterp`, `EDo` (→ nested `andThen`/`pure`), default-method specialization |
| Resolve | `compiler/frontend/resolve.mdk` | Name binding, single- and multi-module |
| Mark | `compiler/frontend/marker.mdk` | After desugar+resolve, before typecheck. Rewrites interface-method `EVar`→`EMethodRef` so typecheck can stamp the resolved impl key per call site |
| Typecheck | `compiler/types/typecheck.mdk` | Hindley-Milner + interfaces + effects; invokes Exhaust per `EMatch` |
| Exhaust | `compiler/frontend/exhaust.mdk` | Maranget pattern-matrix algorithm; called *from* typecheck |
| Eval | `compiler/eval/eval.mdk` | Tree-walking interpreter; dict-passing typeclass dispatch |

Support files:

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `compiler/driver/loader.mdk` | Multi-file dependency walk, topo sort, cycle detection; `medaka.toml` project-root walk-up |
| `compiler/driver/diagnostics.mdk` | Accumulating error pipeline — phases collect errors, no exit-on-error |
| `compiler/driver/build_cmd.mdk` | `medaka build` — Core IR lower → LLVM emit → clang |
| `compiler/driver/medaka_cli.mdk` | CLI entry: `check`/`fmt`/`new`/`build`/`run`/`test`/`doc`/`lint`/`manifest`/`repl`/`lsp` |
| `compiler/ir/core_ir.mdk` + siblings | Core IR types, lowering (`core_ir_lower.mdk`), S-expr (`core_ir_sexp.mdk`), DCE (`dce.mdk`), interpreter (`core_ir_eval.mdk`) |
| `compiler/backend/llvm_emit.mdk` | LLVM text IR emitter |
| `compiler/backend/wasm_emit.mdk` | WasmGC text IR emitter (2nd backend) |
| `compiler/backend/private_mangle.mdk` | Universal constructor name mangling |
| `compiler/backend/trmc_analysis.mdk` | Tail-recursion-modulo-cons analysis |
| `compiler/types/annotate.mdk` | Type annotation helpers |
| `compiler/tools/printer.mdk` / `fmt.mdk` | AST→source round-trip / comment-preserving formatter |
| `compiler/tools/lsp.mdk` | LSP over stdio: diagnostics, formatting, symbols, hover, definition, highlight, completion, inlay hints |
| `compiler/tools/lint.mdk` | `medaka lint` — modular AST linter on the RAW pre-desugar AST. Per-file `Rule` + cross-file `CrossFileRule` registries (add a rule = one fn + one list entry); `--fix`; `--deny`/`--disable`/`--only` |
| `compiler/tools/doctest.mdk` | Doctest extraction for `medaka test`. Two paths: import-bearing files → multi-module chain; prelude-only → single-file + arg-tag fallback (deliberate — the multi-module path would coalesce a redefined prelude standalone and error every example at once) |
| `compiler/tools/check.mdk` / `check_policy.mdk` | `medaka check` entry + policy checker |
| `compiler/tools/test_cmd.mdk` / `prop_runner.mdk` | `medaka test` — doctests + property tests |
| `compiler/tools/doc.mdk` / `new_cmd.mdk` / `repl.mdk` | `medaka doc` / `medaka new` / `medaka repl` |
| `compiler/support/util.mdk` + siblings | Compiler-private helpers + thin wrappers over `stdlib/` (e.g. `ordmap` wraps stdlib `Map`). Stdlib imports ARE allowed — weigh per module, see Traps |

`stdlib/`: `runtime.mdk` (extern primitive catalog, read from disk at runtime), `core.mdk`
(implicit prelude — `Eq`/`Ord`/`Debug`/`Num`/…), plus `list`/`string`/`array`/`map`/`set`/
`io`/`hash_map`/`hash_set`/`mut_array`/`json`/`byteparser`/`bytebuilder`. `map`/`set` are
weight-balanced ordered trees; `hash_map`/`hash_set` are mutable hash tables; `mut_array` is
a growable vector (amortized-O(1) `push`); `json` is a recursive-descent parser/serializer;
`byteparser`/`bytebuilder` are a binary parser-combinator library and its symmetric output
builder. **Only `core.mdk` is auto-prelude** — import the rest by bare name (`import map`).
`io.mdk` is the ergonomic layer over the `runtime.mdk` IO externs.

## 🚦 How work lands: `main` is PROTECTED — you cannot push to it

**Every change goes through a PR.** `git push origin main` fails with `GH013: Repository
rule violations`. There is **no admin bypass**, for anyone. A rejected push is the rule
working, not a credentials problem: open a PR.

```sh
git checkout -b <topic>              # never commit on main
# ... work; verify with `make preflight` ...
git push -u origin <topic>
gh pr create --fill
gh pr merge --auto --merge           # merges itself the moment all 9 checks go green
```

**Nine required checks:** the six `gates (…)` shards, `soundness`, `seed-health`, `inlang`.
**Zero approvals required** — the *checks* are the gate, not a human, so an agent can
self-merge on green. The repo is org-owned (MedakaLang), so a **merge queue is live** — see above; `--auto` enqueues.

Two things that are easy to get wrong:

- **`soundness` is required on purpose.** It runs `typecheck_compiler_source.sh` + the
  self-compile fixpoint + the doc gates. **All gates pass on an ill-typed compiler** — `make medaka` does
  not gate on type errors — which is exactly how a compiler with unbound constructors once
  shipped to `main` with every gate green. The gate shards cannot catch that; `soundness` can.
- **There is a MERGE QUEUE (2026-07-13).** `gh pr merge --auto --merge` **enqueues** your PR;
  the queue does the rest. It builds a temp branch of *your PR merged onto current `main`, plus
  everything queued ahead of you*, runs all nine checks **on that**, and merges only if green —
  so what CI validates is the **merged result**, not your branch in isolation. That is not a
  formality: two green branches have merged cleanly into a **crashing** tree (git auto-merged a
  break it could not see — one branch had added a caller into machinery the other was re-signing,
  on different lines, so no conflict marker).

  **You do NOT need to keep your branch up to date with `main`.** "Strict" mode is OFF and
  `update-branch` kicks are obsolete — the queue handles staleness. If a doc tells you to babysit
  a `BEHIND` branch, that doc is stale.

**Where the backlog and the orchestration rules live** — none of this is reachable from
anywhere else, so it is listed here:

### 🎯 "What should I work on?" → **GitHub Issues.** Not a doc.

```sh
gh issue list --label "S0: silent wrongness"      # always start here — silent wrongness beats everything
gh issue list --label "ws:soundness" --state open # one workstream (ws:soundness|language|tooling|wasm|
                                                  #   diagnostics|testing|release|perf|stdlib)
gh issue list --label "needs-repro"               # inherited claims NOBODY has reproduced
gh issue list --milestone "0.1.0 public preview"  # the release floor
```

**Severity:** `S0: silent wrongness` (a wrong answer or destroyed source, **with no error**) →
`S1: loud breakage` → `S2: misleading` → `S3: friction & debt`. **Soundness outranks release.**

⚠️ **`verified` vs `needs-repro` is load-bearing. REPRODUCE BEFORE YOU FIX.** When the backlog was
re-derived against the binary on 2026-07-14, **six entries were already fixed** — including two
"silent build miscompiles", a duplicate-definition segfault, and a `newtype` bug billed as "the best
value-to-risk item on the board". **Closing an issue as already-fixed is a good outcome; say so.**

| Path | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `.claude/workstreams/` | Per-workstream **domain knowledge**: the traps, the collision map, and *why each bug class recurs*. **Not the backlog** (that is the issue tracker) — read the one matching your labels **before** you start. |
| `.claude/ORCHESTRATING.md` | Orchestration playbook. Its #1 lesson: *the gap docs lie — reproduce before you trust them.* |
| `.claude/HANDOFF.md` | **Known-red gates.** Read BEFORE diagnosing a failing gate — it is usually not your break. |
| `.claude/skills/` | Task playbooks (table at the bottom of this file). |

## Build & test

```sh
make medaka          # WARM (./medaka_emitter present): 2-stage rebuild from current source
                     # COLD (fresh clone): bootstraps from compiler/seed/emitter.ll.gz first
./medaka run yourfile.mdk
```

**In a worktree:** the shell cwd resets between calls, so use
`make -C /absolute/path/to/worktree medaka`. The `./medaka` binary lands in the worktree.

**Borrowing an emitter to warm-start a fresh worktree is safe** (`cp <other-tree>/medaka_emitter .`
then `make medaka`): `build_native_medaka.sh` fingerprints the `compiler/**/*.mdk` each
emitter was built from into `.medaka_emitter.srcstamp` and rebuilds any emitter of unknown
or mismatched provenance. (It used to decide this by **mtime**, which `cp` inverts — that
is where the spurious "lagging seed" scares came from.)

**Environment.** opam/dune are NOT needed. The native build uses only **clang + Boehm GC**
(Debian: `clang` + system `libgc-dev`, found via plain `-lgc`; macOS: Apple clang + `brew
install bdw-gc`). `node` ≥ 24 is needed only for the wasm/sqlite/playground gates. If clang
or libgc is missing, install from the system package manager — don't vendor it.

**Where you're running.** Primary dev is a dedicated **x86_64 Linux box** (Debian 13, 12
cores / 32 GB; repo at `/root/medaka`). Build natively — no container, no VM, no wrapper.
`scripts/docker-dev.sh` + `docker/` (see `docker/README.md`) exist only for the old macOS
laptop's DLP scanner problem, which **does not exist here — do not reach for the Docker
wrapper.**

⚠️ **The dual-platform invariant still holds: every build/test script must run on BOTH
Linux and macOS** (the Mac is retained for macOS smoke-testing; there is no alternative).
When you touch a script, keep both arms alive — `stat -c %Y` *or* `stat -f %m`,
`pkg-config`/`-lgc` *or* `brew --prefix bdw-gc`, no Mach-O-only link flags.

Two platform facts worth not rediscovering: the emitted LLVM IR carries **no target
triple**, so the checked-in seed cold-bootstraps on x86 *or* arm from the same bytes; and
the deeply-recursive compiler gets its stack from a **256 MB GC-aware worker pthread**
spawned in `runtime/medaka_rt.c`, not a link flag — so it runs fine under Linux's default
8 MB `ulimit -s`.

### ⚡ THE AGENT LOOP: `make preflight`. Do NOT run the full suite locally.

**The full suite is CI's job.** Run the gates your change touches; push; let CI run the
other 80 across six parallel hosted runners.

```sh
make preflight       # ✅ THE LOOP — derives the gate set from YOUR diff, and the oracle
                     #    set from those gates. Touching parser.mdk: 9 oracles, 11 gates.
sh test/run_gates.sh 'diff_compiler_parse*'          # ✅ targeted, by name
sh test/build_oracles.sh --for 'diff_compiler_*'     # ✅ fresh-worktree recipe: 52 oracles, ~2 min
FORCE=1 JOBS=1 sh test/build_oracles.sh --build-one <name>   # ✅ exactly one
sh test/run_gates.sh                                 # ❌ all 83
FORCE=1 sh test/build_oracles.sh                     # ❌ all 54 oracles. Almost never right.
```

**This is a real cost, not an aesthetic preference.** Several agents share this box. One
agent running the whole suite + a full oracle build takes the load average past 10 and
**turns a 30-second gate run into several minutes for everyone else.** Worse, bare
`FORCE=1 build_oracles.sh` spawns an `xargs -P` pool that **outlives the agent's turn and
gets RESPAWNED by the harness** — it has killed several agents. Use the targeted forms.

⚠️ **`preflight` is a FILTER, NOT AN AUTHORITY.** It runs a subset and prints what it
skipped. **CI on the PR is the authority. Nothing merges on a green preflight.**

**A full local run IS justified when:** you changed `compiler/backend/*` (run
`selfcompile_fixpoint.sh` — preflight forces this); you changed `compiler/support/*` or
`stdlib/core.mdk` (blast radius genuinely is everything); you are merging two branches that
touched the same subsystem (pre-merge greens do not carry over); or CI says something you
cannot reproduce. Outside those: **push and let CI answer.**

If `run_gates.sh` reports gates FAILED with *"phantom skip: oracle/binary not built"* —
that is **not a regression**, you just have no oracles. (They count as FAILED, not skipped,
on purpose: a gate that ran nothing must never report green.)

### The gates

```sh
make preflight                         # ⚡ the loop (above)
make test                              # IN-LANGUAGE suite (doctests, props, `test "…"`). No oracles.
make gates                             # the FULL 84-gate differential suite
sh test/run_gates.sh 'pat*' 'pat2*'    # multiple patterns (deduped). NOT brace expansion.
make docs-links                        # doc-link rot: every cited path must exist. No compiler.
make agent-doc-symbols                 # doc-symbol rot: every backticked symbol must resolve. No compiler.
make docs-index                        # regenerate docs/README.md (GENERATED — never hand-edit)
```

| Gate | What it proves |
|------|----------------|
| `test/diff_compiler_*.sh` | Differential: native stage output vs captured goldens |
| `test/selfcompile_fixpoint.sh` | Emitter self-compile fixpoint (C3a/C3b) — **THE decisive gate for any compiler-source change** |
| `test/typecheck_compiler_source.sh` | Strict-typechecks the WHOLE compiler source. Run alongside the fixpoint for any compiler `.mdk` change — the bootstrap emit path does NOT gate on type errors, so an ill-typed compiler builds green without this |
| `test/diff_compiler_engines.sh` | **The 3-engine differential**: eval == native == wasm on the SAME programs. Found 4 bug classes on its first run. Ledger: `test/engine_divergence.txt` |
| `test/diff_compiler_perf_scaling.sh` | **The O(n²) detector.** Inputs at N and 2N; grades the *allocation* growth ratio (linear ≈2.0×, quadratic ≈4.0×). Allocation, not wall-clock — GC bytes are deterministic, so it is machine-independent and noise-free |
| `test/diff_compiler_capability_matrix.sh` | Every extern in `stdlib/runtime.mdk` vs what each engine actually implements. Its absence let 37 externs drift for six weeks. Ledger: `test/CAPABILITY-EXCEPTIONS.txt` |
| `test/diff_compiler_tmc_parity.sh` | Both backends TMC the same functions (needs `sh test/wasm/build_wasm_oracle.sh`) |
| `test/bootstrap_*.sh` | Each native pipeline stage == interpreter output |
| `test/check_removed_constructs.sh` | Tree-wide scan for stale uses of removed constructs (~2-3 min, `JOBS=` knob) |

**Stale oracles:** `diff_native_cli` and the bootstrap suites are especially stale-prone —
force-rebuild before trusting a pass/fail from those.

**Parallelism.** The oracle build, `run_gates.sh`, the heavy compiler gates, and every wasm
gate fan out across an `xargs -P` pool — cap with `JOBS=n`, or `INNER_JOBS=n` for per-gate
fan-out inside `run_gates.sh`. Opt-level knobs (`EMITTER_OPT` -O2, `ORACLE_OPT` -O0,
`CLI_OPT` -O2, `WASM_ORACLE_OPT` -O2 — **-O0 overflows the deep-TCO fixtures**) and
`GC_INITIAL_HEAP_SIZE` **all preserve byte-identical emitted IR**: the text IR is produced
before `clang` runs, so an opt level can never change it. Details:
`compiler/PERF-RESULTS.md`.

**Concurrent `medaka build` is scratch-path safe.** `build_cmd.mdk` stages every scratch
file inside ONE `mktemp -d` unique to that build *process*. ⚠️ Until 2026-07-13 the IR path
was keyed on the OUTPUT BASENAME in global `/tmp`, so two concurrent builds writing
`-o <somedir>/out` — different worktrees, different repos — clobbered each other's IR and
produced a **stable-looking WRONG binary** (19/20 iterations). Anything that "keys the temp
file on something distinctive" is a trap; only a per-process temp dir is correct. Still run
a newly-parallelized gate several times — a temp-collision flake shows ~1 in N.

### Pre-commit hook (ACTIVE) — fmt + lint

`.githooks/pre-commit` runs two checks over each staged `.mdk` (`test/` fixtures excluded —
they violate style on purpose). Re-install after a fresh clone:
`cp .githooks/pre-commit "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/hooks/pre-commit"`.

- **Format** — `medaka fmt --check` rejects any staged unformatted `.mdk`. The whole tree is
  clean. **Run `medaka fmt --write <changed.mdk>` and re-`git add` before committing any
  `.mdk` edit.** `fmt` is idempotent and safe, so `--write` on a clean file is a no-op.
- **Lint** — the tree is at **0 findings and the hook is a MAX RATCHET: all ~20 rules gated**,
  so any NEW finding of any rule fails the commit. The cross-file `rule-duplicate-body` can't
  be checked per-staged-file, so the hook also runs one whole-project scan (`medaka lint
  compiler stdlib sqlite`). **Run `medaka lint` on files you touch.** Silence a genuine
  exception inline: `-- lint-disable-next-line <rule>` (also `-- lint-disable-line`,
  `-- lint-disable-file`; omit the rule to disable all). ⚠️ `medaka lint --fix` **bails on any
  decl containing an interior comment** (it would otherwise drop them) — safe, but it leaves
  comment-bearing sites unfixed.

Emergency bypass for either: `git commit --no-verify`. If `medaka` isn't built, the hook
warns and allows.

### Debugging a `.mdk` program

`medaka check <file>` prints human `file:L:C:` diagnostics. **`medaka check --json <file>`**
(note: `--json`, not `--format=json`) emits one JSON object per diagnostic carrying a stable
**`code`** (`T-*` type · `R-*` resolve · `P-*` parse · `L-*` lex · `W-*` warning), a `kind`,
a real `range` (0-based LSP line/char), `severity` (1=error, 2=warning), the `message`, and —
for suggestion-bearing errors — a `help` string plus a machine-applicable
`fix { range, replacement }` you can apply verbatim. **When reacting to compile errors
programmatically, prefer `--json` and key off `code`** — it is the stable handle and doesn't
move when wording changes.

When **writing** a diagnostic, follow `compiler/ERROR-QUALITY.md` (the rubric) and add the
code to `compiler/DIAGNOSTIC-CODES-DESIGN.md`.

**Playground e2e:** `playground/e2e/` is a Playwright harness driving a real browser against
the built CM6 playground (`cd playground/e2e && ./run.sh`). Needs **node v24+** and a
pre-built `playground/dist/playground.wasm`; uses the **system** Chrome. See
`playground/e2e/README.md`.

## Traps

Each of these was paid for in an incident. **They are pointers, not post-mortems** — the
narrative lives at the link.

- ⚠️ **Changing the emitter? Read the `benchmark-emitter` skill BEFORE measuring anything.**
  A binary's *behavior* comes from its source but its *speed* comes from the emitter that
  compiled it, so you need **two** rebuilds to get a single-generation binary. One rebuild
  crosses the arms and makes an optimization look like a regression (a real 2.2× win once
  measured as a 2.5× slowdown). Same skill covers seed re-mints — `test/refresh_seed.sh` is
  **not idempotent after a codegen change; run it TWICE** — and why a **stale seed can
  SEGFAULT the fixpoint on a perfectly correct change**.
- ⚠️ **Chasing a slow stage or a red `perf_scaling`? Read the `perf-hunt` skill.** Profile
  **allocation** (deterministic) over wall-clock (noisy); use **DWARF** call graphs; and note
  `whenL False (expensiveCall …)` is **NOT a stub** — Medaka is strict, so the argument still
  evaluates (this produced a false "hypothesis disproved" on a *correct* hypothesis).
- ⚠️ **A dispatch bug that reproduces through the loader but is green single-file is
  *usually* the EVAL DRIVER, not dict-passing** (recurred at Phases 96/103/121/125). **But
  verify — Phase 134 was the documented inverse**, and the two-probe comparison did *not*
  flag it. Full method, both probes, and the instrument-the-resolution-arms technique:
  **`debug-pipeline` skill**. Regression tests for this class must exercise the multi-module
  path (`test/diff_compiler_eval_modules.sh`), not a single-file doctest.
- ⚠️ **`evalModules` (`eval/eval.mdk`) and `cevalModules` (`ir/core_ir_eval.mdk`) are PARALLEL
  module drivers — fix module-frame semantics in LOCKSTEP.** `cevalModules` deliberately
  mirrors `evalModules` (same frame layout, same `importFrameOf`/`pubReexports`/`installConsts`
  helpers), so a fix to one is **silently absent from the other**. That is how the P0-9
  cross-module ctor-collision fix shipped patching only `eval.mdk`, leaving `core_ir_eval.mdk`
  broken for months. Underlying hazard: **`installConsts` + `findCell` is last-write-wins on
  duplicate names**, so any flat frame keyed by *bare name* across modules inherits it (e.g.
  `map`'s arity-5 `Bin` vs `set`'s arity-4 `Bin` collapse into one cell). The fix shape is a
  per-module **local** ctor frame that shadows the global.
- ⚠️ **A FIXTURE DIRECTORY IS A SHARED CORPUS.** Adding, moving, or deleting a fixture
  silently enrolls (or de-enrolls) you in gates you never named. Before touching one, find
  every consumer — `grep -rl '<fixture_dir>' test/` — then run **all** of them. Known
  multi-consumer dirs: `test/eval_modules_fixtures/*/` → `diff_compiler_eval_modules.sh`
  **and** `diff_compiler_core_ir_modules.sh` (P0-9 shipped "green" having run only the first);
  `test/wasm/fixtures/` → **four** consumers (`diff_wasm.sh`, `diff_compiler_engines.sh`,
  `tmc_census.sh`, and the keys of `test/engine_divergence.txt`).
- ⚠️ **The compiler's own sources are IN the snapshot corpus, so a source change MOVES ITS
  OWN GOLDEN. Bless it in the SAME commit.** Push the source without the golden and `main`
  goes red, and the hook then forces the *next* agent to bless a file they never touched —
  the exact "rubber-stamp someone else's regression" hazard blessing exists to prevent. Bless
  by NAMING the path; `--bless` refuses to rubber-stamp a whole corpus.
- **The compiler MAY import `stdlib/`** — deliberately, per module (policy changed
  2026-06-29; the old blanket ban is retired). **Weigh it per module, don't import
  reflexively.** Measured:
  - Importing a module whose types' instances live in `core` (the always-present prelude) is
    **near-free** — `import list`/`import string` drag no new instance surface, so DCE trims
    to the referenced standalone fns (**−256 B, +2% ≈ noise**).
  - Importing a module that defines a **NEW type** is not: DCE keeps every `DImpl`/`DInterface`
    *whole* (runtime dict-passing → pruning an impl would be a silent miscompile), so
    `import map` drags `Map`'s entire Eq/Ord/Debug/Display/Mappable/Monoid surface in
    (**+34 KB binary, +4.8% self-compile**).
  - ⚠️ **Anti-pattern (measured): do NOT delegate the compiler's hot monomorphic helpers to
    prelude Foldable methods** (`elem`/`any`/`all`/`length`). They lose `||`/`&&`
    short-circuiting and become dict-passed fold+closure — doing this to `util.mdk`'s hottest
    helpers cost **+56% self-compile.** Keep hot inner-loop helpers monomorphic and
    short-circuiting.
  - Also: the imported module is re-typechecked on every compile *and* every fixpoint
    iteration; and once the compiler imports a stdlib module, any change there that perturbs
    emitted IR **forces a seed re-mint + fixpoint re-validation** (a feature — it converts
    silent `support/`-vs-`stdlib/` divergence into a build-time gate — but it is churn).
  - Migrating a `support/` structure to stdlib: a **polymorphic empty must be a nullary
    constructor** (a constructor *application* like `OMap Tip` is NOT generalized → it
    monomorphises → "Scheme vs Unit" cascades). Any harness running the emitter/probes over
    compiler source must pass `$STDLIB` as well as the compiler root.
- **Tuples are internally `__tupleN__`-headed `TApp` spines, not a `TTuple` node.**
  `(,)`/`(,,)`/`(,,,)`/`(,,,,)` in TYPE position names the bare *unsaturated* tuple
  constructor — that is what lets a higher-kinded typeclass bind to it (`impl Bimappable (,)`
  in `core.mdk`). A saturated `(a, b)` head is kind-inconsistent and deliberately unsupported.
  See `compiler/TUPLE-TYPE-CONSTRUCTOR-DESIGN.md`.
- **Errors accumulate.** Phases push into `compiler/driver/diagnostics.mdk` rather than
  raising on the first error. **Don't add early-exit/raise paths.**
- **To run a whole program, `main` must be a zero-arg value** (`main = …`, not `main () = …`).
  `medaka run` evaluates top-level bindings and checks `main` exists but never *applies* it,
  so `main () = …` is a silent no-op (exit 0, no output). Use `main = println …` for probes.
- **Medaka multi-arg lambdas are `x y => body`**, not curried `x => y => body`. Curried forms
  predating Phase 59.6 are legacy artifacts — match `x y => body` in new code.
- **The prelude is marked + dict-passed in the typed pipeline** (`markWithPrelude`,
  `compiler/frontend/marker.mdk`), so elaboration reaches prelude methods like
  `pure`/`when`/`unless`. **Untyped eval** (no marker/typecheck — e.g. quick eval tests)
  falls back to arg-tag "first impl wins" for return-position methods. `pure` needs types to
  dispatch, so **route it through the typed pipeline.**
- **Match-arm guards and refutable pattern-guards (`Pat <- e`) both lower natively and work
  in both forms.** Historically neither did; the multi-clause refutable-guard case was a
  run≠build **miscompile** until 2026-07-13 (the `__fallthrough__` sentinel read its jump
  target from a mutable Ref that `emitDecision` nulls across a body-level match — and a
  refutable guard desugars to exactly such a match, so "try the next clause" became
  `@mdk_oob`). It now carries its target in the node (`labelFallthrough`,
  `backend/emit_support.mdk`) — the design the **WasmGC backend already had, which is why
  wasm was never wrong.** Full write-up: `compiler/EMITTER-GAPS.md`.
- **In a worktree, edit the worktree's files — use the full absolute path.** The shell cwd
  resets to the main checkout each call, so a relative `grep -n compiler/foo.mdk` runs
  *there*; Read/Edit that bare path and you have silently changed the **main checkout**,
  which your worktree build never sees. If you slip: `cp` the edited files into the worktree,
  then `git -C <main> checkout -- <files>`.
- **For layout questions** (legal indentation shapes, leading-op set, then/else, tabs,
  let…in wrapping), `docs/spec/LAYOUT-SEMANTICS.md` is ground truth. A lexer-vs-spec
  divergence is a lexer bug; a SYNTAX/PLAN-vs-spec divergence is a doc bug.
- Development is organized by numbered **Phases**. Open work: `PLAN.md`. Completed Phases
  1–97 with implementation notes: `archive/PLAN-ARCHIVE.md`. Commits reference phase numbers.

## Dogfooding the language

The stdlib and `compiler/` are written *in* Medaka, so prefer its idioms — but **only where
they genuinely improve readability**. Don't force-fit: most candidate sites aren't
improvements, and a rewrite that doesn't typecheck or that changes semantics is worse than
the original. **Verify the rewrite on the binary** (`medaka test <file>`).

Under-used but working: **operator sections** — `(==)`, `(+ 1)`, `(2 * _)` (left needs an
explicit `_`) instead of lambdas; pipe `|>`; compose `>> <<`; inclusive ranges `[lo..=hi]`;
record update `{ r | f = v }`; unary `!`.

⚠️ **Do NOT reach for these — they are REMOVED and are hard parse errors**, each with a
dedicated removal diagnostic in `compiler/frontend/parser.mdk`: the **`function` keyword**
(use `x => match x { … }` or a multi-clause definition), **`let mut`** (use a `Ref`:
`let x = Ref 0`, `x := v`, read `x.value`), **backtick infix** `` `f` `` (use prefix
application), the **`record` keyword**, **`let-else`**, **named impls**, and **`default
impl`**. `test/check_removed_constructs.sh` is the tree-wide gate that keeps them out.

`docs/spec/SYNTAX.md` is the ground-truth list of what parses (⚠️ with one known lie: it
still lists backtick infix, which the parser rejects). `test/parse_fixtures/rare_constructs.mdk`
has minimal examples. The self-hosted parser doesn't cover everything — see PLAN.md "Known
parser gaps" before assuming `compiler/` can parse a construct.

## Writing tests

Tests are shell-based golden-diff harnesses: each `test/diff_compiler_*.sh` runs a native
pipeline stage against goldens in `test/*_fixtures/` or `test/*_goldens/`.

1. Add a fixture to the appropriate `test/` fixture directory (⚠️ first read the
   shared-corpus trap above).
2. Capture a golden: `bash test/capture_goldens.sh`, or the specific gate with `CAPTURE=1`.
3. Verify: `bash test/diff_compiler_<name>.sh` passes.

Add cases to the gate matching the stage you changed (parser change →
`test/diff_compiler_parse*.sh` or `diff_compiler_check*.sh`).

## Task playbooks (skills)

**Skills are planning inputs, not just implementation aids.** At task triage — including
during plan-mode exploration, *before* writing the plan — match the task against this table
and load the matching skill rather than re-deriving the workflow. (A `UserPromptSubmit` hook,
`.claude/hooks/skill-triage.py`, nudges this on PLAN.md/Phase prompts.)

| Skill | When |
|-------|------|
| **add-language-feature** | Thread a new construct through the whole pipeline. **Also the right skill for most cross-cutting work that *looks* like typechecking** — see below. |
| **add-primitive** | Add/modify a stdlib `extern` primitive (native, in `compiler/eval/eval.mdk`). |
| **extend-stdlib** | Implement/extend a *pure-Medaka* stdlib function, impl, doctest, or prop. Not for externs. Normally user-reserved; load when asked. |
| **debug-pipeline** | Diagnose a parse/typecheck/eval failure. **Reach here first for a dispatch bug that reproduces through the loader but works single-file.** |
| **harden-typechecker** | Typechecker-*internal* work: add a `type_error`, tighten constraint/coherence/unification logic. |
| **perf-hunt** | A stage is slow, or `diff_compiler_perf_scaling.sh` is red. Find the O(n²). |
| **benchmark-emitter** | ANY change to `compiler/backend/*` you intend to measure, or a fixpoint failure on a change that looks correct. |
| **add-lsp-capability** | Add/extend an LSP feature. |
| **pr-review** | Review an agent-authored PR diff for craft. Read-only; run AFTER CI is green. |

⚠️ **`harden-typechecker` is narrower than it looks.** Adding a `type_error` does NOT by
itself make a task typechecker-internal. If the fix threads through resolve/eval/desugar/AST
*as well*, it is **add-language-feature** — that was true of Phase 69 (dispatch), Phase 63
(`deriving`, desugar-rooted), Phase 72 (field-name reuse: added a type_error, but the bulk was
a multimap threaded through resolve *and* typecheck), Phase 73 (bidirectional checking), and
Phases 83/84 (dict-threading through AST + typecheck + dict_pass + eval). **Check where the fix
actually lands before loading it.**

## Doc index

**`docs/README.md` is THE doc index** — generated from every doc's own `**Status:**` banner
(`make docs-index`), so it cannot drift. Go there for the full catalog. The rows below are
only the ones an agent reaches for constantly.
