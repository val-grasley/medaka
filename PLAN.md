# Medaka — Roadmap

The working handoff between sessions. Read it before starting a task; update it
when you finish one. This document holds only **forward-looking** work — the
completed Phases 1–97 (with their detailed implementation notes) live in
[`PLAN-ARCHIVE.md`](./PLAN-ARCHIVE.md). For how to build/test and the codebase's
non-obvious gotchas, see [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md).

## Current status (2026-06-02)

The compiler pipeline is complete end-to-end —
`lexer → parser → resolve → method_marker → typecheck → exhaust → desugar →
eval` — and 97 numbered phases are done. The language has records, ADTs,
interfaces (with superinterfaces, `deriving`, dictionary-passing for
return-position/multi-param dispatch), effect rows, exhaustiveness checking,
`do`-notation, guards (with fall-through), list comprehensions, string
interpolation, type aliases/newtypes, property testing, doctests, an LSP server,
a formatter, and a project-config/`medaka new` surface. Operators are wired to
the real `Eq`/`Ord`/`Num` interfaces in `core.mdk` (Phase 52).

The stdlib in Medaka covers `core`, `list`, `array`, and a drafted `string`
(STDLIB.md Modules 1–4). The remaining stdlib modules are user-written by
design (see the stdlib division-of-labor convention).

**Conventions.** Work is still organized by numbered **Phases**; commit messages
and code comments reference them. Phases that were left *partial* keep their
original number (e.g. Phase 82, 91, 92); genuinely new work gets the next free
number continuing from 97. At task triage, match the work against AGENTS.md's
task-playbook table and load the matching skill before planning.

## North star — self-hosting, then LLVM

The long-term goal that orders everything below: **rewrite the Medaka compiler
in Medaka, then compile it to native code via LLVM.** Chosen path (2026-06-02):
**bootstrap on the existing tree-walking interpreter first** — get a self-hosted
compiler running (slowly but correctly) on the interpreter, *then* build the
LLVM backend so that compiler emits native code. This validates the language as
a real engineering medium before we pay for the heavy memory-model / GC / codegen
work.

Most items in the Open roadmap are small course-corrections; this section is the
destination they steer toward. Three stages, each a gate on the next.

### Stage 0 — Prerequisites before self-hosting can begin

The language is already expressive enough to *describe* a compiler (ADTs,
records, exhaustive pattern matching, interfaces, modules, effects — all done).
What's missing is the supporting surface a real multi-thousand-line program needs:

- **Standard library breadth.** The compiler needs the data structures it is
  itself built on:
  - **`Map` / `Set`** (and likely a hash variant) — symbol tables, scopes,
    type-variable substitutions, impl registries. *Today: missing (Phase 19
    modules 5–6).* This is the single biggest gap.
  - **`io`** — read source files, write artifacts, stdin/stdout, process args,
    exit codes, structured error reporting. *Today: missing (Phase 19 module 7).*
  - `string` finalized and reviewed (drafted; awaiting review).
- **Language stability / completeness.** Close the sharp edges that would bite a
  large codebase, then *freeze the surface syntax and semantics* for the duration
  of the port:
  - ~~Resolve the `do`→`Thenable` question (Phase 98)~~ — **DONE.** `do` is now
    load-bearing on `Thenable`: a `<-` bind over a non-`Thenable` type is a
    compile-time error (see PLAN-ARCHIVE.md Phase 98).
  - Multi-module / return-position dispatch residuals (Phase 83/84) shouldn't
    force arg-tag workarounds in compiler code.
  - Guard exhaustiveness + inline guards (Phase 91) — pervasive in a compiler.
- **Interpreter performance, "good enough" to bootstrap.** Running the compiler
  *on* the interpreter must finish in minutes, not hours. May require interpreter
  hot-path work (the eval loop, environment representation) — measure once the
  stdlib is in place and a non-trivial program exists.
- **Multi-file ergonomics at scale.** The module system, qualified access, and
  `medaka.toml` workspaces exist; confirm they hold up across the dozens of files
  a compiler needs. Surface gaps here become new phases.

### Stage 1 — Self-host on the interpreter

Port the pipeline (`lexer → parser → resolve → typecheck → exhaust → desugar →
eval`) into Medaka, one stage at a time, checked against the OCaml reference at
each step. **Done when** Medaka-in-Medaka compiles a real program identically to
the OCaml compiler, and ultimately compiles *itself*. The output of this stage is
a validated language and a compiler whose only slow part is the interpreter
underneath it.

### Stage 2 — LLVM backend (after self-host)

With the language proven, build native codegen. The heavy, decision-dense work
deliberately deferred to here:

- **A frozen Core IR** as the codegen input: desugared, fully typed, effects
  erased, **dictionaries explicit**. The existing elaboration already inserts
  `EMethodRef`/`EDictApp` — that is the foundation; this stage commits to it as a
  serializable lowering target.
- **Typeclass lowering strategy:** runtime dictionary passing (already the eval
  model) vs. monomorphization. Decide deliberately — it shapes the whole backend.
- **Memory model & value representation:** heap allocation, closure layout,
  tagged ADTs/records, boxing/unboxing. *Decision-dense; the real cost of going
  native.*
- **Garbage collection:** conservative (Boehm) to start vs. reference counting
  vs. a precise collector. Strict + functional + closures ⇒ this is unavoidable.
- **Runtime library:** re-implement the `extern` catalog (today OCaml in
  `eval.ml`, incl. Unicode via `uucp`, arrays, strings, IO) against the native
  runtime.
- **LLVM lowering:** Core IR → LLVM IR, calling convention, FFI.
- **Bootstrap closure:** self-hosted compiler + LLVM backend compiles itself to a
  standalone native binary — the finish line.

## Open roadmap

Each item is independently shippable; pick one per session. Grouped by area, not
strict priority. Where an item is a **Stage 0 prerequisite** for the north star
above, it is flagged ⭐.

### Compiler / language

- **Phase 99 — lower `do` to `andThen`/`pure` (make it true sugar).** Follow-up
  to Phase 98, which took the self-contained route: a `Thenable` *constraint* on
  the block monad, with eval still binding `<-` at runtime via the
  `monadic_ctors` hashtable + the `andThen` VMulti (`lib/eval.ml`'s `eval_do`).
  The more principled approach deferred there is to **desugar `EDo` into nested
  `andThen` / `pure` calls** so `do` is pure sugar over the interface and eval's
  `eval_do` / `monadic_ctors` special-casing can be deleted — bind dispatch then
  flows through the same typed dictionary elaboration (`EMethodRef`/`EDictApp`)
  as any other constrained call, instead of an eval-time arg-tag/hashtable
  lookup. Payoff: one dispatch path, correct routing for polymorphic
  `Thenable m => … do …` (overlaps the Phase 83/84 `pure`-dispatch residuals),
  and less runtime machinery.
  - **Crux (why it's more than a `desugar.ml` edit):** for the lowered
    `andThen`/`pure` to be dictionary-dispatched, the lowering must happen
    **before `method_marker` + typecheck** (the marker rewrites method `EVar`s to
    `EMethodRef` *before* typecheck; the post-typecheck `desugar.ml` stage is too
    late). So this is a pipeline-placement change, not just a new lowering.
  - **Semantics to audit:** today a non-final `DoExpr` (`lib/eval.ml`) evaluates
    and *discards* its value — it does **not** sequence through `andThen`.
    Lowering `e; rest` to `andThen e (\_ => rest)` makes sequencing genuinely
    monadic (e.g. `None; …` short-circuits), which is *more* correct but a
    behavior change to confirm against existing tests. Also handle `DoLet` /
    `DoLetElse` (lower to plain `let`) and the do-block forbidden forms.
  - Keep Phase 98's win: a `<-` over a non-`Thenable` type must still be a
    compile-time error (it will be, since the lowered `andThen` carries the
    `Thenable` constraint at its use site). Skill: **add-language-feature**
    (cross-cutting: pipeline ordering + `desugar.ml` + `eval.ml`).

- ⭐ **Phase 91 (continued) — guard gaps.** Fall-through (item 1) is done; two
  remain:
  - **(2) Compile-time non-exhaustive-guard detection.** Today an exhausted
    guard chain is a runtime error. `exhaust.ml` does pattern matrices but not
    guard coverage. Guards are arbitrary `Bool`, so only `| otherwise` /
    literal-`True` coverage is decidable — a conservative "guards may not be
    exhaustive" warning is the realistic target. Lands in `lib/exhaust.ml`.
  - **(3) Inline guard form.** `f n | n <= 0 = []` on one line is a parse error;
    guards must be on indented continuation lines. Lands in `lib/parser.mly` /
    `lib/lexer.mll` — re-measure parser conflicts after the grammar change.
  - Skill: **add-language-feature**.

- **Phase 92 (continued) — doctest harness reaches cross-module instances.**
  `medaka test <file>` type-checks via the single-file `check_program`, so a
  doctest can't see an instance defined in a *sibling* stdlib module (e.g. a
  `core` doctest that `show`s an `Array`, whose `Show Array` lives in
  `array.mdk`). String/Char were special-cased into the prelude; the general fix
  routes `lib/doctest.ml` through the multi-module (`typecheck_module`) path.
  Note the hazard documented in the archive: flattening `list.mdk` + `array.mdk`
  into one module merges their deliberately-reused top-level names — the fix must
  preserve module separation. Skill: **add-language-feature** (touches the
  doctest harness, not just the typechecker).

- **Phase 42 (residual) — property-test generators.** The `prop`/`Arbitrary`
  machinery is done, but `lib/prop_runner.ml`'s `gen_for_type` has gaps:
  - No generation for `Array a` or tuples.
  - Parametric user types (`TyApp (TyCon custom, _)`) aren't routed through
    `Eval.arbitrary_registry` — only nullary `TyCon custom` is.
  - Built-in generation is native OCaml and bypasses the Medaka-level
    `arbitrary`/`shrink` methods; unifying both paths (drive everything through
    the interface) is open.
  - Skill: **add-primitive** / **add-language-feature** depending on approach.

- ⭐ **Phase 83 / 84 (residuals, deferred — layered like 69.x→74).** Lower priority;
  each is a known limitation with a correct-enough fallback today:
  - Runtime dict-threading *into* an inferred constrained body (currently arg-tag
    dispatch, correct for argument-dispatched wrappers). Needs a post-typecheck
    marker re-run against the final constraint tables — a pipeline restructure.
  - Self-/mutually-recursive *unsignatured* wrappers under-infer their own
    recursive-call routing.
  - `pure` in a do-block with **no `<-`** is groundable only from surrounding
    type context.
  - `Result e` with a free `e` mis-dispatches even when signatured (a multi-param
    dict-resolution gap).
  - Skill: **harden-typechecker** / **add-language-feature** (cross-cutting).

### CLI surface (Phase 82, continued)

The design spec lists `new build run check test fmt lsp doc add remove update`;
`check / run / test / repl / lsp / fmt / new` exist, plus `bench`. Remaining
non-package-manager gaps:

- **`medaka build`** — needs its own design first: there is no artifact cache or
  typed-IR serialization format in the tree, so "typecheck + cache" has no honest
  implementation. Until that exists it would only be an alias of `check`.
- **`medaka doc`** — needs (a) a comment→decl matcher (doc comments aren't
  attached to AST nodes — a parallel `Lexer.take_comments()` stream matched by
  position, like `doctest.ml` does), (b) a signature renderer for a typechecker
  `scheme`, and (c) an output-format decision.
- **`medaka check --json` multi-file** — currently single-file (`Diagnostics.
  analyze` doesn't invoke the `Loader`), so a file with `import`s can
  resolve-error in the JSON output. Multi-file `--json` is the follow-up.
- Skill: none specific (lands in `bin/main.ml` + `lib/lsp_server.ml`).

### Stdlib enablement (Phase 19 — user-owned)

Deliberately hand-written by the user; listed for completeness, not as agent
work unless explicitly delegated (see the stdlib division-of-labor convention).

- ⭐ **`stdlib/string.mdk`** is drafted and passes its 45 doctests but is flagged
  *awaiting user review* (archive Phase 75 step 3). Open decisions: the
  `length`/`isEmpty`/`count` omissions and `toUpper` vs `charToUpper` naming.
- **Modules 5–8 unstarted:** `map`/`set` (persistent trees), `mut_array`/
  `hash_map`/`hash_set`, `io` (`readFile`/`writeFile`/`readLine`), `json`
  (type + parser + serializer). Expect each to surface new language gaps —
  record them here as new phases when they do.
  - ⭐ **`map`/`set` and `io` are the critical-path Stage 0 prerequisites** — a
    self-hosted compiler can't be written without symbol tables and file I/O.
    (`mut_array`/`hash_map`/`hash_set` matter mainly for interpreter/compiler
    *performance*; `json` is not on the self-hosting path.)

### Blocked on a package manager (out of scope until one exists)

- `medaka add` / `remove` / `update`, and a `medaka.lock` file.

## Won't-do (kept intentional)

- **Phase 78c — multi-module method shadowing.** Investigated 2026-06-01 and
  dropped: the motivating need (`length`/`isEmpty`/`toList` on `Array`) is
  already met by interface impls, and there is no safe export path for a bare
  `length : String -> Int` (it would shadow `Foldable.length` everywhere). The
  real lever, if ever needed, is a `Sized`/`HasLength` interface — which is
  stdlib design, not a compiler feature. Reopen only for a genuine, non-cosmetic
  need that interface impls can't serve.
- The broader **rejected-features** list (labeled arguments, active patterns,
  computation expressions, polymorphic variants, first-class modules, row
  polymorphism, macros, lazy sequences, higher-rank polymorphism, custom
  symbolic operators, …) lives in PLAN-ARCHIVE.md §8 with per-item rationale.
  Consult it before proposing any of them so the rejection stays intentional.
