# Medaka — Roadmap

The working handoff between sessions. Read it before starting a task; update it
when you finish one. This document holds only **forward-looking** work — the
completed Phases 1–97 (with their detailed implementation notes) live in
[`PLAN-ARCHIVE.md`](./PLAN-ARCHIVE.md). For how to build/test and the codebase's
non-obvious gotchas, see [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md).

## Current status (2026-06-02)

The compiler pipeline is complete end-to-end —
`lexer → parser → desugar → resolve → method_marker → typecheck (runs exhaust)
→ eval` — and 97 numbered phases are done. The language has records, ADTs,
interfaces (with superinterfaces, `deriving`, dictionary-passing for
return-position/multi-param dispatch), effect rows, exhaustiveness checking,
`do`-notation, guards (with fall-through), list comprehensions, string
interpolation, type aliases/newtypes, property testing, doctests, an LSP server,
a formatter, and a project-config/`medaka new` surface. Operators are wired to
the real `Eq`/`Ord`/`Num` interfaces in `core.mdk` (Phase 52).

The stdlib in Medaka covers `core`, `list`, `array`, a drafted `string`
(STDLIB.md Modules 1–4), and `map` (Module 5, the weight-balanced ordered map);
`set` is next. As of 2026-06-02 the user lifted the hand-write-it-myself
constraint and delegated the remaining modules.

**Conventions.** Work is still organized by numbered **Phases**; commit messages
and code comments reference them. Phases that were left *partial* keep their
original number (e.g. Phase 82, 91, 92); genuinely new work gets the next free
number continuing from 97. At task triage, match the work against AGENTS.md's
task-playbook table and load the matching skill before planning.

## North star — self-hosting, then LLVM

The long-term goal that orders everything below: **rewrite the Medaka compiler
in Medaka, then compile it to native code via LLVM.** Chosen path (2026-06-02):
**bootstrap on the existing tree-walking interpreter first** — get a self-hosted
compiler running (slowly but correctly) on the interpreter, *then* build the
LLVM backend so that compiler emits native code. This validates the language as
a real engineering medium before we pay for the heavy memory-model / GC / codegen
work.

Most items in the Open roadmap are small course-corrections; this section is the
destination they steer toward. Three stages, each a gate on the next.

### Stage 0 — Prerequisites before self-hosting can begin

The language is already expressive enough to *describe* a compiler (ADTs,
records, exhaustive pattern matching, interfaces, modules, effects — all done).
What's missing is the supporting surface a real multi-thousand-line program needs:

- **Standard library breadth.** The compiler needs the data structures it is
  itself built on:
  - **`Map` / `Set`** (and likely a hash variant) — symbol tables, scopes,
    type-variable substitutions, impl registries. *Today: missing (Phase 19
    modules 5–6).* This is the single biggest gap.
  - **`io`** — read source files, write artifacts, stdin/stdout, process args,
    exit codes, structured error reporting. *Today: missing (Phase 19 module 7).*
  - `string` finalized and reviewed (drafted; awaiting review).
- **Language stability / completeness.** Close the sharp edges that would bite a
  large codebase, then *freeze the surface syntax and semantics* for the duration
  of the port:
  - ~~Resolve the `do`→`Thenable` question (Phase 98)~~ — **DONE.** `do` is now
    load-bearing on `Thenable`: a `<-` bind over a non-`Thenable` type is a
    compile-time error (see PLAN-ARCHIVE.md Phase 98).
  - Multi-module / return-position dispatch residuals (Phase 83/84) shouldn't
    force arg-tag workarounds in compiler code.
  - ✅ Guard exhaustiveness + inline guards (Phase 91) — done. (Plain
    multi-clause non-guard exhaustiveness remains; see below.)
- **Interpreter performance, "good enough" to bootstrap.** Running the compiler
  *on* the interpreter must finish in minutes, not hours. May require interpreter
  hot-path work (the eval loop, environment representation) — measure once the
  stdlib is in place and a non-trivial program exists.
- **Multi-file ergonomics at scale.** The module system, qualified access, and
  `medaka.toml` workspaces exist; confirm they hold up across the dozens of files
  a compiler needs. Surface gaps here become new phases.

### Stage 1 — Self-host on the interpreter

Port the pipeline (`lexer → parser → desugar → resolve → typecheck (runs
exhaust) → eval`) into Medaka, one stage at a time, checked against the OCaml
reference at each step. **Done when** Medaka-in-Medaka compiles a real program identically to
the OCaml compiler, and ultimately compiles *itself*. The output of this stage is
a validated language and a compiler whose only slow part is the interpreter
underneath it.

### Stage 2 — LLVM backend (after self-host)

With the language proven, build native codegen. The heavy, decision-dense work
deliberately deferred to here:

- **A frozen Core IR** as the codegen input: desugared, fully typed, effects
  erased, **dictionaries explicit**. The existing elaboration already inserts
  `EMethodRef`/`EDictApp` — that is the foundation; this stage commits to it as a
  serializable lowering target.
- **Typeclass lowering strategy:** runtime dictionary passing (already the eval
  model) vs. monomorphization. Decide deliberately — it shapes the whole backend.
- **Memory model & value representation:** heap allocation, closure layout,
  tagged ADTs/records, boxing/unboxing. *Decision-dense; the real cost of going
  native.*
- **Garbage collection:** conservative (Boehm) to start vs. reference counting
  vs. a precise collector. Strict + functional + closures ⇒ this is unavoidable.
- **Runtime library:** re-implement the `extern` catalog (today OCaml in
  `eval.ml`, incl. Unicode via `uucp`, arrays, strings, IO) against the native
  runtime.
- **LLVM lowering:** Core IR → LLVM IR, calling convention, FFI.
- **Bootstrap closure:** self-hosted compiler + LLVM backend compiles itself to a
  standalone native binary — the finish line.

## Open roadmap

Each item is independently shippable; pick one per session. Grouped by area, not
strict priority. Where an item is a **Stage 0 prerequisite** for the north star
above, it is flagged ⭐.

### Compiler / language

- **Phase 99 — lower `do` to `andThen`/`pure` (make it true sugar). ✅ DONE.**
  `Desugar.lower_do_blocks` (`lib/desugar.ml`) now rewrites `EDo` into nested
  `andThen`/`pure` calls (mirroring the list-comp lowering: bare `ELam [pat]` for
  irrefutable binds, a 2-arm `EMatch` ending in `__fallthrough__` for refutable
  ones). It runs **after `desugar_questions`, before `method_marker` + typecheck**
  (also threaded into `desugar_expr` for the REPL), so the emitted bare
  `andThen`/`pure` EVars get marked to `EMethodRef`/`EDictApp` and bind dispatch
  flows through the normal dictionary elaboration — `eval.ml`'s `eval_do` + the
  `monadic_ctors` hashtable are deleted, and the `EDo` typecheck arm is now an
  `InternalError` guard. The `Thenable` obligation rides the lowered `andThen`'s
  constraint, so Phase 98's win is preserved structurally (a `<-` over a
  non-`Thenable` type is still a compile-time error; a `pure`-only block pulls no
  Thenable obligation). Behavior changes (intended): a non-final `DoExpr` now
  sequences monadically (`None; …` short-circuits), and a single-statement
  `do x` is just `x` (identity, no forced monad). Do-block well-formedness
  (no `let mut`/assign/field-assign; no bad terminator) moved to a pre-lowering
  scan raising `Desugar.Do_error`, caught at the driver/test `Type_error` sites.
  Imperative IO/`let mut` sequences now use a bare indented block (`EBlock`),
  which is untouched. Skill: **add-language-feature**.

- ✅ **Phase 91 — guard gaps (done).** All three items complete:
  - (1) Fall-through (archived).
  - (2) Compile-time non-exhaustive-guard detection — a conservative "guards may
    not be exhaustive" warning. Function-clause guards (`EGuards`) desugar to
    `EIf` chains before exhaust runs, so this is a standalone pre-desugar lint
    (`Exhaust.check_guard_exhaustiveness`, wired into the `Diagnostics` drivers +
    `bin/main` `check`/`run`). It reuses the `useful` pattern matrix over a
    constructor oracle built from the program's own data decls + builtins, so a
    partial guard chain is *excused* when sibling clause patterns already cover
    every input (e.g. a final `f _ = ..` clause). Closed prelude types
    (Option/Result/Ordering) aren't in a user file's AST, so guards discriminating
    on them conservatively warn — an accepted limitation of the type-free pass.
  - (3) Inline guard form — `f n | n <= 0 = []` on one line (single arm; further
    arms keep the indented-block / separate-clause forms). Added to `inner_fun_def`
    and `where_binding` in `lib/parser.mly`; no new parser conflicts (still 3).

- **Phase 92 — doctest harness reaches cross-module instances. ✅ DONE.**
  `medaka test <file>` now routes a file that imports real sibling modules
  through the multi-module (`typecheck_module`) path in `lib/doctest.ml`
  (`run_file_multi`), mirroring `medaka run`/`check`: load the dependency graph
  via `Loader`, inject the synthetic `__dt_i__` doctest bindings into the root
  module, resolve + mark + two-pass-typecheck each module separately (so
  deliberately-reused top-level names stay unmerged), then dict-pass + eval. A
  doctest sees what its module **imports**. A file with no imports — or whose only
  imports were the implicit prelude `core` (which the loader filters, so no real
  sibling loads) — keeps the single-file path, which `prelude_for`-shadow-drops
  redefined names (this is what lets `stdlib/string.mdk`, which redefines the
  prelude standalone `count`, still doctest cleanly).
  - **Non-goal (intentional):** a *reverse* dependency — a `core` doctest that
    `show`s an `Array`, whose `Show Array` lives downstream in `array.mdk` — is
    **not** supported. The prelude reaching into a module that imports *it* is a
    layering inversion; String/Char already live in the prelude for exactly this
    reason, and no such doctest exists. The import graph is the source of truth.

- **Phase 101 — drive property generation/shrinking through the `Arbitrary`
  interface.** Phase 42's generator gaps are closed (`lib/prop_runner.ml` now
  generates `Array`, tuples, and parametric user types structurally, with
  matching shrinking — see PLAN-ARCHIVE.md Phase 42). What remains is the
  *principled* version: `gen_for_type`/`shrink_value` are still native OCaml, so
  a user's hand-written `arbitrary`/`shrink` impl is not actually called for
  built-in or structurally-generated types, and parametric generation works by
  the runner substituting type arguments itself rather than by passing element
  dictionaries. Unifying both paths — drive every generator/shrink through the
  Medaka-level interface via the dict-passed typed pipeline — would let
  hand-written impls win and element dictionaries flow into parametric
  instances. It is deferred because it intersects the Phase 83/84
  return-position dispatch residuals (a post-typecheck marker re-run / pipeline
  restructure). Lands in `lib/prop_runner.ml` + the typed/dict-passing pipeline.
  Skill: **add-language-feature** (cross-cutting).
  - **101a — DONE (2026-06-02).** `lib/eval.ml` gains a `shrink_registry`
    (mirror of `arbitrary_registry`, populated from an `impl Arbitrary T` that
    *overrides* `shrink`); `lib/prop_runner.ml` `gen_for_type`/`shrink_value`
    consult the registries first (generation gated to nullary head) with native
    fallback, so a hand-written/`deriving` `arbitrary`/`shrink` actually wins —
    **including container elements**, because native `gen_for_type` recurses and
    each element routes through `arbitrary_registry` (`List Tagged` →
    `[Tagged 7,…]`, all nesting handled). Also fixes a pre-existing bug: native
    generation only matched single-arg `Result`; two-arg `Result e a` now
    generates (`Ok a` / `Err e`) instead of crashing.
  - **101b (synthesized typed generators + parametric `core.mdk` Arbitrary impls)
    — DEFERRED, reassess later.** Phase 83/84 (now in main) made single-level
    interface-driven generation work (`impl Arbitrary (List a)` correctly
    generates `List Int`/`List Tagged`/`Option Int`), but **nested** parametric
    elements (`List (List Int)`) still fail — the flat `VDict of string` dict
    model can't carry a recursive element dict. Since 101a (native + registry
    recursion) already handles every case **including nesting** and makes
    hand-written element impls win, 101b's only unique gain is honoring a user's
    custom `impl Arbitrary (List a)` *generation strategy* — a niche case that
    also needs a native fallback for nested/tuple/`Result`. Revisit only if a
    concrete need for custom container-generation strategies arises (would also
    want structured/recursive dicts to lift the nesting limit). The synthesized-
    generator WIP is on branch `claude/suspicious-sammet-21d73e` (commit
    `860ba12`) for reference.

- ✅ **Phase 102 — plain multi-clause exhaustiveness. DONE.** A plain
  multi-clause function (`f Nil = ..` with no `Cons` clause) never becomes an
  `EMatch`, so `check_match` never saw it — an uncovered case surfaced only as a
  runtime `Impl_no_match`. New `Exhaust.check_clauses` runs from the end of
  `process_letrec_group` (covering all entry points + the REPL) with a type-aware
  oracle (`exhaust_oracle`, backed by `env.type_ctors`/`env.ctors`, so prelude
  types like `Option`/`List` are enumerable — unlike the Phase 91(2) lint's
  data-decl-only oracle). Each clause's parameter list is wrapped as one synthetic
  `__tuple__` column (the same reduction `check_group` uses). No genuine stdlib
  partials surfaced; the one false positive was `Unit` missing from the
  `type_ctors` builtin seed (now fixed). See PLAN-ARCHIVE.md. Skill:
  **harden-typechecker**.

*(Phases 103–105 + 107 below were surfaced implementing Module 5 `map`,
2026-06-02 — see the per-item repros.)*

- **Phase 103 — nullary return-position method dispatch is unreliable.** Two
  facets, both reproduced on the 2026-06-02 binary:
  - **(a) Shipped bug — type ascription ignored.** `array`'s standalone
    `empty : Array Int` panics `arrayLength: expected Array` under `medaka run`:
    the bare nullary `empty` mis-dispatches to the *first* `Monoid` impl
    (`List`'s `[]`) instead of honoring the `: Array Int` ascription. `empty :
    List Int` only "works" by luck (List is the first impl). So `array.empty` is
    effectively broken today wherever it's used through the typed pipeline.
  - **(b) Constrained impl can't ground its dict.** A nullary return-position
    method whose impl carries a `requires` (`impl Monoid (Map k v) requires Ord
    k where empty = Tip`) can't supply the `Ord k` from result-type context — the
    flat `VDict` can't carry it — so the call errors `no matching impl for
    dispatch`. This is the **nullary** continuation of the Phase 83/84
    return-position residuals (Phase 96 fixed the *unconstrained* nullary case
    like `minBound`; this is the constrained + ascription-driven case).
  - **Workaround in map.mdk:** no `impl Monoid (Map k v)`; use a standalone
    `empty` (= `Tip`) and the `Tip` constructor internally. `Semigroup.append`
    (arg-position) is fine. **Fix unblocks:** maps/sets/arrays as proper
    `Monoid`s, and removes the `array.empty` footgun. Lands in
    `typecheck.ml`/`method_marker.ml`/`dict_pass.ml`/`eval.ml`. Skill:
    **harden-typechecker** (likely cross-cutting → **add-language-feature**).

- ✅ **Phase 104 — parser: a leading `_` (or `_name`) as the *first* lambda
  parameter mis-parses as a constructor. DONE.** `(_ x => …)` /
  `(_k v acc => …)` failed with `Unknown constructor: _`; a `_` in any
  *non-first* position was fine (`(k _ acc => …)`). Root cause was **not** a
  grammar conflict but a buggy constructor-head test in the expr-first
  binding-LHS lowering (`expr_to_pat`/`expr_to_pats` in `lib/parser.mly`): both
  used `Char.uppercase_ascii c.[0] = c.[0]`, which is `true` for `_` (and digits)
  since underscore has no case — so a leading-`_` application head was lowered to
  `PCon ("_", …)`. Fixed by factoring `is_ctor_name s` (an explicit `'A'..'Z'`
  ASCII-range check, matching the already-correct third site) and using it at all
  three constructor-head checks. No grammar rule changed → `parser.conflicts`
  unchanged at 3. Regression tests in `test/test_parser.ml`
  (`lambda leading wild` / `lambda leading underscore name` /
  `lambda nonfirst wild`). See [[project_binding_lhs_expr_first]].

- **Phase 105 — exhaustiveness false-positive on imported-type constructors.**
  Phase 102's `Exhaust.check_clauses` warns `non-exhaustive clauses` for a
  function that *fully* covers an **imported** data type's constructors
  (`depth Tip = …; depth (Bin …) = …` over an imported `Map`), while the
  identical match on a **locally-declared** type does not warn. The clause oracle
  (`exhaust_oracle`, from `env.type_ctors`/`env.ctors`) isn't seeing constructors
  brought in by `import`. Conservative (warning only, eval still runs) but noisy
  for any module using imported ADTs. Lands in the oracle construction in
  `lib/typecheck.ml` (feed imported `te_ctors`). Skill: **harden-typechecker**.

- **Phase 106 — minor ergonomics surfaced by Module 5 (low priority).**
  - **Import a type with its constructors in one token.** `import map.{Map}`
    does *not* bring `Tip`/`Bin`; each constructor must be listed. A Haskell-style
    `import map.{Map(..)}` (or auto-importing a `public` type's constructors)
    would cut friction for ADT-exporting modules. Lands in `lib/resolve.ml` +
    parser import syntax.
  - **`Ordering`'s `Eq` constructor clashes with the `Eq` interface name**, so
    BST code must match `compare` as `Lt`/`Gt`/`_` and can never name the equal
    case. Longstanding; a rename (`Equal`?) or namespacing would remove the
    workaround but is a breaking change — likely **won't-do**, recorded for
    intentionality.

- ⭐ **Phase 83 / 84 (residuals, deferred — layered like 69.x→74).** Lower priority;
  each is a known limitation with a correct-enough fallback today:
  - **Instance-`requires` dict-threading into return-position impl bodies — DONE
    (2026-06-02, single-level).** An impl's `requires` dicts now thread into its
    method bodies so a *return-position* element ref resolves via the element dict
    (e.g. `impl Arbitrary (List a) requires Arbitrary a where arbitrary () =
    arbitraryList arbitrary 8` now generates `List Tagged` as `[Tagged 7, …]`
    instead of panicking `no matching impl for dispatch`). Mechanism mirrors
    69.x-e: a per-impl `impl_dict_routes` table (impl-local slots, keyed by
    impl_key) feeds `find_enclosing_dict`; the call site stamps a new
    `res_impl_dicts` on the `EMethodRef`; `dict_pass` prepends the matching params
    to the impl clause; eval applies them after `res_method_dicts`. **Gated to
    return-position methods** (the dispatch param appears only in the result):
    arg-position methods (`show`/`eq`/`compare`) stay on arg-tag dispatch, which
    already handles nesting. **Remaining limitation:** *nested* parametric element
    types (`List (List Int)`) don't fully thread — the flat impl-key dict model
    (`VDict of string`) can't carry a recursive element dict, so the inner list's
    own element dict is missing; single-level (`List Int`, `List Tagged`,
    `Option Int`) works. Lands in `ast.ml`/`typecheck.ml`/`dict_pass.ml`/`eval.ml`.
    This unblocks the common cases of **Phase 101**.
  - Runtime dict-threading *into* an inferred (unsignatured top-level) constrained
    body (currently arg-tag dispatch, correct for argument-dispatched wrappers).
    Distinct from the impl-body case above. Needs a post-typecheck marker re-run
    against the final constraint tables — a pipeline restructure.
  - Self-/mutually-recursive *unsignatured* wrappers under-infer their own
    recursive-call routing.
  - `pure` in a do-block with **no `<-`** is groundable only from surrounding
    type context.
  - `Result e` with a free `e` mis-dispatches even when signatured (a multi-param
    dict-resolution gap). (Did not reproduce on the 2026-06-02 binary with the
    probes tried; re-verify before working it.)
  - True recursive/nested instance dictionaries (the `List (List Int)` case above)
    need structured dicts rather than flat impl-key strings — the real
    "pipeline restructure."
  - Skill: **harden-typechecker** / **add-language-feature** (cross-cutting).

### CLI surface (Phase 82, continued)

The design spec lists `new build run check test fmt lsp doc add remove update`;
`check / run / test / repl / lsp / fmt / new` exist, plus `bench`. Remaining
non-package-manager gaps:

- **`medaka build`** — needs its own design first: there is no artifact cache or
  typed-IR serialization format in the tree, so "typecheck + cache" has no honest
  implementation. Until that exists it would only be an alias of `check`.
- **`medaka doc`** — needs (a) a comment→decl matcher (doc comments aren't
  attached to AST nodes — a parallel `Lexer.take_comments()` stream matched by
  position, like `doctest.ml` does), (b) a signature renderer for a typechecker
  `scheme`, and (c) an output-format decision.
- **`medaka check --json` multi-file** — currently single-file (`Diagnostics.
  analyze` doesn't invoke the `Loader`), so a file with `import`s can
  resolve-error in the JSON output. Multi-file `--json` is the follow-up.
- Skill: none specific (lands in `bin/main.ml` + `lib/lsp_server.ml`).

### Stdlib enablement (Phase 19)

Originally hand-written by the user by design; as of 2026-06-02 the user lifted
that constraint and delegated the remaining modules (Modules 5–8). STDLIB.md is
the per-module checklist.

- **Phase 107 — `core.mdk` gaps surfaced by Module 5 (2026-06-02).**
  - **`Foldable.isEmpty` / `length` have no default body** — only `foldMap`
    does, yet the interface comment *and* STDLIB.md claim all three default. So
    every `Foldable` impl (List, Array, and any new one like a future tree) is
    forced to spell out `isEmpty`/`length`. Either add the default bodies
    (`isEmpty t = ...` via `toList`; `length = fold (acc _ => acc + 1) 0` — mind
    the point-free-dispatched-method eval trap, eta-expand) or correct the
    misleading comment + STDLIB.md. Lands in `stdlib/core.mdk`. Skill:
    **extend-stdlib**.
  - **No `fst` / `snd` tuple accessors** in core (`fst (1,2)` → `Unbound
    variable: fst`). Trivial to add (`fst (a, _) = a` / `snd (_, b) = b`); add to
    `core.mdk` utilities, or decide they're intentionally omitted (pattern-match
    instead) and document it. Skill: **extend-stdlib**.

- ⭐ **`stdlib/string.mdk`** is drafted and passes its 49 doctests but is flagged
  *awaiting user review* (archive Phase 75 step 3). Open decisions: the
  `length`/`isEmpty`/`count` omissions and `toUpper` vs `charToUpper` naming.
- **Module 5 — `map`/`set` (ordered):**
  - ✅ **`stdlib/map.mdk` — DONE (2026-06-02).** Weight-balanced BST (Adams /
    `Data.Map`, `data Map k v = Tip | Bin Int k v …`, `delta = 3`, `ratio = 2`).
    Full API (insert/insertWith/adjust/delete/lookup/member/union/unionWith/
    difference/intersectionWith/min-max views/folds-with-key/keys/elems/
    filterWithKey) + `Mappable`/`Eq`/`Show`/`Semigroup` instances + an exported
    `wellFormed` invariant checker. 33 doctests + 7 props (700 cases) green;
    depth 15 for 1000 ascending inserts. See STDLIB.md Module 5 for the full
    surface + the two gotchas: (a) **no `Monoid (Map k v)`** — `Monoid.empty` is
    return-position and can't supply the instance's `Ord k` (Phase 83/84 flat-dict
    limit); use the standalone `empty`/`Tip`. (b) `Foldable` deliberately skipped
    so `toList` keeps meaning assoc-pairs.
    - **Compiler change:** removed `"Map"` from `resolve.ml`'s `primitive_types`
      (it was a reserved placeholder), so the stdlib `data Map` is canonical —
      mirroring `Option`/`Result`/`Ordering`.
  - ⏳ **`stdlib/set.mdk`** — next. Same tree; decide standalone-element-tree vs.
    `Map a Unit` wrapper.
  - **Phase 108 (deferred) — wire the `Map { k => v }` / `Set { … }` literal
    sugar.** Surface syntax already parses to `EMapLit`/`ESetLit` and the names
    `Map`/`Set` are reserved for it (resolve.ml still reserves `Set`); eval stubs
    them as `VCon "<Name>.fromList"`. Make them desugar to a real `fromList` call
    on the imported module (requires the module in scope at the literal site).
    Unused anywhere today → low priority. Skill: **add-language-feature**.
- **Modules 6–8 unstarted:** `mut_array`/`hash_map`/`hash_set`, `io`
  (`readFile`/`writeFile`/`readLine`), `json` (type + parser + serializer).
  Expect each to surface new language gaps — record them here as new phases.
  - ⭐ **`set` (finishing Module 5) and `io` are the remaining critical-path
    Stage 0 prerequisites** — a self-hosted compiler needs symbol tables (have
    `map` now) and file I/O. (`mut_array`/`hash_map`/`hash_set` matter mainly for
    *performance*; `json` is not on the self-hosting path.)

### Blocked on a package manager (out of scope until one exists)

- `medaka add` / `remove` / `update`, and a `medaka.lock` file.

## Won't-do (kept intentional)

- **Phase 78c — multi-module method shadowing.** Investigated 2026-06-01 and
  dropped: the motivating need (`length`/`isEmpty`/`toList` on `Array`) is
  already met by interface impls, and there is no safe export path for a bare
  `length : String -> Int` (it would shadow `Foldable.length` everywhere). The
  real lever, if ever needed, is a `Sized`/`HasLength` interface — which is
  stdlib design, not a compiler feature. Reopen only for a genuine, non-cosmetic
  need that interface impls can't serve.
- The broader **rejected-features** list (labeled arguments, active patterns,
  computation expressions, polymorphic variants, first-class modules, row
  polymorphism, macros, lazy sequences, higher-rank polymorphism, custom
  symbolic operators, …) lives in PLAN-ARCHIVE.md §8 with per-item rationale.
  Consult it before proposing any of them so the rejection stays intentional.
