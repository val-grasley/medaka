# diff_compiler_snapshot_types_user.sh — PRELUDE-AWARE, user-only typecheck schemes for
# the real-program corpus, as a snapshot gate. docs/ops/TESTING-DESIGN.md §4.3; #81 (the
# prelude-aware # TYPES arc). Mirrors diff_compiler_snapshot_eval.sh.
#
# ── WHY A SEPARATE SECTION (# TYPES_USER, not # TYPES) ────────────────────────
# The existing `# TYPES` snapshot (diff_compiler_snapshot_types.sh) is prelude-FREE —
# correct for the minimal typecheck_fixtures, which test errors WITHOUT a prelude in
# scope. test/diff_fixtures/ are REAL programs that reference prelude types, so they must
# be typechecked with core.mdk in scope. The probe gates that USED to cover them
# (diff_compiler_typecheck_golden.sh + _batch.sh, RETIRED #81 Stage B1) diffed the
# FULL prelude+user scheme dump — ~120 lines/fixture, ~117 of them the SAME prelude table
# repeated across all 57 fixtures (6,810 lines, ~90% redundant). Snapshotting that
# verbatim is the anti-pattern the snapshot design rejects.
#
# So `# TYPES_USER` (snapshot.mdk `typesUserOf`) typechecks core.mdk ++ fixture but keeps
# ONLY the user program's own scheme lines (name-filtered by funNamesOf — see snapshot.mdk
# for why name-filtering beats full−baseline: context-sensitive prelude inference like
# `abs` leaks otherwise). The whole-prelude-inference invariant those probe gates also
# carried is NOT this gate's job — it moved (#81 Stage B1) to a single full-prelude dump,
# diff_compiler_snapshot_prelude.sh (a `# TYPES` snapshot of stdlib/core.mdk).
#
# Proven at introduction: every `# TYPES_USER` line appeared verbatim in the frozen
# diff_fixtures/*.golden `=== TYPES ===` section — 57/57, zero prelude leakage — so the
# user schemes are byte-correct AND prelude-aware. That redundancy was the whole point:
# #81 Stage C2 then EMPTIED those golden `=== TYPES ===` sections (header kept, content
# deleted) — this snapshot IS the surviving pin for the user schemes, so re-cut it here,
# not there.
#
# ── SHARED CORPUS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# test/diff_fixtures/ is now read by this gate ALSO (also: the frontend snapshot gate's
# diff_fixtures family; the diff_compiler_check.sh / check_batch.sh probe gates, whose
# clean leg is a subset check against THIS `# TYPES_USER` snapshot since #81 Stage C; and
# the eval/core_ir run gates, which read the frozen `=== EVAL ===` golden — the
# `=== TYPES ===` section is empty since Stage C2). Adding, moving, or deleting a fixture
# there enrolls/de-enrolls it here too.
#
# ── RE-CUTTING ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# match_nonexhaustive renders a diagnostic `# TYPES_USER` (a non-exhaustive-match
# warning), which is UNBLESSABLE by construction. To re-cut it, DELETE its .md and re-run
# with --new; the clean fixtures re-cut with --bless.
#
# Usage:  sh test/diff_compiler_snapshot_types_user.sh          # CHECK (the gate)
#         sh test/diff_compiler_snapshot_types_user.sh --new    # create MISSING snapshots
#         sh test/diff_compiler_snapshot_types_user.sh --bless <path>...
#
# Exit:   0 if every snapshot matches (or every named fixture blessed), else 1.
