# diff_compiler_perf_scaling.sh — the O(n²) detector.
#
# PROBLEM: agents keep introducing quadratic algorithms into the compiler. Three
# have been found and fixed in a single night (resolve's contigGo, five sites in
# typecheck, and a third in the check driver). Nothing was watching.
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT A WALL-CLOCK GATE
# ---------------------------------
# The obvious design — "fail if the build takes >N seconds" — is WRONG here, and
# would have been worse than nothing:
#
#   * CI runs on SHARED HOSTED RUNNERS that vary 2-3x run to run. A wall-clock
#     threshold is either too loose to catch anything real, or it flaps constantly
#     and gets ignored. A gate people ignore is a gate that does not exist.
#   * A constant-factor slowdown and an ALGORITHMIC blowup are different bugs. Only
#     the second gets catastrophically worse as the codebase grows, and it is the
#     one actually being introduced.
#
# WHAT THIS MEASURES INSTEAD: **SCALING**.
#
# Feed the same operation inputs of size N, 2N, 4N and check the GROWTH RATIO per
# doubling. Runner speed CANCELS OUT of a ratio:
#
#     linear      O(n)        -> ~2.0x per doubling
#     n log n                 -> ~2.1x
#     QUADRATIC   O(n^2)      -> ~4.0x     <-- what we are hunting
#
# PRIMARY METRIC IS ALLOCATION, NOT TIME. This is the key insight from the hunt:
# GC-allocated bytes are DETERMINISTIC — they do not depend on runner speed, cache
# state, or load at all. So an allocation-ratio gate is simultaneously
# machine-independent AND noise-free, which no timing gate can be. Time is reported
# too, but only informationally; it is never the pass/fail signal.
#
# Empirically, allocation is also the CLEARER signal: both quadratics found on
# 2026-07-13 showed up more sharply in alloc (typecheck 676MB -> 2239MB across ONE
# doubling) than in wall-clock, and one of them (resolve) is only milliseconds at
# these sizes, so its timing is pure noise while its allocation ratio is stark.
#
# Usage:  sh test/diff_compiler_perf_scaling.sh
#         PERF_N=250 sh test/diff_compiler_perf_scaling.sh   # base size
# Exit:   0 all shapes scale sub-quadratically; 1 a shape regressed; 2 opt-in skip.

# ── KNOWN SUPERLINEAR (a ledger, NOT a skip-list) ────────────────────────────
#
# A shape listed here is ALREADY superlinear — a real, filed bug. It is recorded
# rather than skipped, following the same model as diff_compiler_engines.sh's
# ledger, CAPABILITY-EXCEPTIONS.txt, and rustc's tests/crashes. Each entry asserts
# the CURRENT, WRONG behavior, so that:
#
#   (a) the bug cannot get any worse silently — a listed shape still FAILS if it
#       exceeds its recorded ceiling; and
#   (b) an ACCIDENTAL FIX is DETECTED — if a listed shape drops back to linear, this
#       gate FAILS and demands promotion.
#
# (b) is the whole point and is why this is not a skip-list. A skip-list cannot
# notice when a bug is fixed, so it ROTS — which is precisely how test/ported/ died
# (nothing ran it for months) and how diff_compiler_lint_multi sat "skipped" while
# also failing. Do not "simplify" this into a skip.
#
# (Currently EMPTY — every shape scales sub-quadratically. Long may it last.)
#
# HISTORY — entries that were fixed and promoted OUT of this ledger:
#
#   match — exhaustiveness checking (compiler/frontend/exhaust.mdk + the
#           `check_match` driver in compiler/types/typecheck.mdk) over an
#           N-constructor data decl with an N-arm match. Filed as T17, ratio
#           CLIMBING with N (2.48x -> 2.75x -> 3.10x per doubling; 274 MB net
#           allocation at N=1000). FIXED 2026-07-13: it was FOUR quadratics
#           stacked, all of the same "re-scan the whole thing once per element"
#           shape — `usefulCovered` called `specializeCon` (a full matrix scan)
#           once per signature constructor, `allCovered` did an O(#ctors x #rows)
#           list-membership scan, the constructor oracle's four tables were assoc
#           LISTS so every arity/type lookup was O(#ctors), and the redundant-arm
#           fold re-ran the whole Maranget recursion against every preceding arm.
#           Now: rows are bucketed by head constructor in ONE pass, the oracle is
#           an OrdMap, and the redundancy fold skips arms that provably cannot be
#           unreachable. 3.10x -> 2.18x; 274 MB -> 118 MB at N=1000.

The pattern found every time so far: a List being scanned / elem-checked /
lookup-ed / rebuilt ONCE PER ELEMENT. Note that \`xs ++ [x]\` inside a fold is
O(n^2) all by itself (list append is O(n)).

To localize it:
  MEDAKA_PERF=1 test/bin/profile_main stdlib/runtime.mdk stdlib/core.mdk <fixture>
gives per-STAGE time and allocation. Then \`perf\` (apt-get install linux-perf) to
name the hot symbol -- but note call graphs are unusable in these binaries (tail
calls, no frame pointers); use FLAT symbol counts only.

WARNING: \`whenL False (expensiveCall ...)\` is NOT a stub -- Medaka is strict, so
the argument still evaluates. To stub something out, actually remove the call.
