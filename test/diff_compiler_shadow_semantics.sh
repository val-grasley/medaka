# SHADOW-SEMANTICS decision-matrix gate (docs/spec/SHADOW-SEMANTICS.md).
#
# test/shadow_fixtures/ is the enforcement corpus for that spec -- one fixture
# per matrix cell -- and until this gate existed NOTHING ran it (audit finding,
# 2026-07-13: 5 orphaned fixture directories tree-wide; this was the worst,
# because it is a SPEC's enforcement, not just a regression corpus). A design
# agent needing to know what a cell actually does had to drive every fixture by
# hand. See test/diff_compiler_run_check_agreement.sh for the general shape
# this gate follows (check/run/build agreement, exit-code AND value).
#
# ⚠️ THIS GATE PINS WHAT THE BINARY ACTUALLY DOES ON CURRENT MAIN, NOT WHAT THE
# SPEC SAYS SHOULD HAPPEN. Per clause S7, `run`/`check`/`build` are specified to
# agree on every cell, so this gate checks all three -- exit-code verdict AND,
# for cells where run+build both accept, that they print the SAME, PINNED
# value (a P0-20-shaped bug -- build exits 0 printing a WRONG number -- is
# invisible to an exit-code-only gate; see that gate's own history).
#
# As of this writing (main past PR #25/#26/#27, binary rebuilt from THAT tree),
# every matrix cell that ships a fixture in test/shadow_fixtures/ is CONFORMANT
# -- check/run/build agree with each other AND with the doc's S1-S9-specified
# outcome -- EXCEPT d11 (below). That includes rows 10/12/13/14 (d4b/d5b/d9/d8),
# whose STATUS column in the doc's section-2 table used to say BUG: that column
# was STALE (P0-19 2026-07-10 + P0-20 2026-07-13 closed all four, as the doc's
# OWN section-5 update notes said a few paragraphs below the stale table). This
# gate's empirical run is what proved it, and the table has now been corrected
# to match -- with this gate cited as the enforcement.
#
# d10 is the ledger working as designed. It was added by THIS gate as a
# KNOWN-BAD row pinning the S-1 bug (a CONSTRAINED standalone `Num a =>` shadow
# whose RLocal route carried no dictionary -- check green, run E-PANIC, build
# silently printing a garbage heap pointer). PR #25 then FIXED it, and this
# gate went RED on the very next run -- exactly what a ledger entry is for ("it
# must FAIL when the bug is fixed, so it can't rot"). The row is now re-pinned
# to the FIXED behavior: ACCEPT/ACCEPT/ACCEPT, value 4, run == build.
#
# d11_definer_multityparam_iface.mdk remains the one KNOWN-BAD row: a
# multi-TYPARAM interface (`interface Ix a i`) bypasses the whole
# definer-shadow machinery, because every entry point gates on
# `singleParamIfaceMethod`, which counts INTERFACE type params, not method
# params. `check` and `build` agree (and are in fact per-receiver CORRECT,
# printing 4 then 3) while `run` E-PANICs (`unknown op '*'`) -- an S7
# path-agreement violation. No fix is in flight (doc section 5, residual #2 /
# "S-3"). Its row is pinned to that CURRENT split; it goes red the day `run`
# is taught this shape, which is the signal to correct the row, not silence
# it. A KNOWN-BAD row is not a skip -- it runs and asserts every turn.
#
# Untested-per-the-doc (rows 21-23: importer value-position / importer N-way /
# return-position method shadow) ship NO fixture in test/shadow_fixtures/ and
# are out of scope here -- adding fixtures for them is follow-up work, not a
# silent gap in THIS gate (this gate covers 100% of what test/shadow_fixtures/
# actually contains, checked by the coverage self-audit below, which fails
# loudly the moment a new fixture is dropped into the directory without being
# wired into the TABLE).
